[6 ways staff engineers help reach clarity](https://medium.com/volvo-cars-engineering/6-ways-staff-engineers-help-reach-clarity-963c1878accb) - Alex Ewerlöf

Being at the Staff/Principal doesn’t mean knowing everything.  Ewerlöf describes a number of other roles they can play in helping people find answers, with “knowing the answer” being probably the least valuable case:

1. The Go-To: you have the answer
2. The Rubber ducky: you’re the coach/mentor that helps them answer their own question
3. The Catalyst: you know the people who have pieces of the answer
4. The Detective: you know how to find the answer
5. The Communicator:  you know how to communicate the answer
6. The Researcher: you know the experiment that will produce the answer
7. Other: you know how to wait for or work around the unknown
