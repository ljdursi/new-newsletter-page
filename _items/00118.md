[A Checklist For Evaluating New Technology](https://www.gustavwengel.dk/evaluating-new-technology) - Gustav Wengel

In a similar vein as the above, a pragmatic way of looking at a possible new tool or technology or even methodology to adopt.  The checklist items most relevant to us:

- Does it solve a problem you’re actually having *right now*?
- Is it easily replaced?
- Can it be evaluated quickly?
- Is the project/technology popular and well maintained?
- How mature is it?
- Can it be maintained?

Of all of them, I think “Is it easily replaced” is the one which is important and undervalued.
