[Get More Feedback This Week](https://lauratacho.com/blog/get-more-feedback-this-week) - Laura Tacho

Specific guidance along the lines of what we discussed last week about getting more feedback:

- Be specific - ask for super-specific feedback/advice/guidance
- Be timely - ask for it immediately after what you want input on, or even before
- Be gracious - reward the behaviour you want to see more of!  Thanking them, taking the input seriously, and even letting them know later how you incorporated the input makes it more likely youâ€™ll get good feedback in the future.
