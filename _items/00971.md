[9 Tips for Effectively Sharing Peer Feedback in the Workplace](https://fellow.app/blog/2021/tips-for-effectively-sharing-peer-feedback-in-the-workplace/) - Mara Carvello

Worth comparing this to what we discussed earlier on feedback.   Carvello councils use of on-judgmental language, and focus on the problem not the individual; those are consistent with talking about behaviour and impact.  Be prepared to have a conversation - makes sense when talking with peers.  We’ve talked in other issues about how the “feedback sandwich” approach is known not to work; the way to “cushion” negative feedback with positive feedback isn’t to batch them in threes, it’s to be frequently giving positive feedback!

Beyond that I think the assumption behind this article is that one has feedback conversations only occasionally, a special thing you have to brace yourself for, rather than it be an ongoing part of everyday work conversations.
