[Focus: assign multiple engineers to the same task](https://dpc.pw/focus-assign-multiple-engineers-to-the-same-task) - Dawid Ciężarkiewicz

We’ve talked here quite a bit - starting way back in [#13](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/c2837919-4d09-42d4-bed7-f569120c7d07) - about pull requests as asynchronous pair programming, and the benefits of pair programming - not merely for quality control but for knowledge sharing in both directions.

In this thought-provoking article, Ciężarkiewicz argues in favour of routinely having two (or more!) team members assigned to a task, so that rather than a code review at the back - or even before pair programming at a shared IDE would start - two people are bouncing the problem and possible solutions back and forth.   The argument is that this leads to:

- faster technical growth of team members,
- better team cohesion as people work and interact more closely together against the same problem,
- better knowledge sharing,
- higher quality of the code and design,
- less burn-out as people can focus more on one thing with less distraction,
- the work actually assigned getting done faster.

My take on research software development is that one of its defining characteristics is *subtlety*, rather than (in many other areas of software development) complexity - and thus having more input more often is important; so I tend to find Ciężarkiewicz’s argument pretty compelling.

What do you think?  Have you seen research software teams routinely assigning pairs of team members to tasks?  How did it go - what were the advantages and drawbacks?
