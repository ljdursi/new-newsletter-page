[Making World-class Docs Takes Effort](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/09/04/making-world-class-docs-takes-effort/) - Daniel Stenberg

Documentation is incredibly important for a product’s adoption and use - whether the tool is software, data products, systems, or (increasingly) a combination of the three. It takes a lot of work, but that work pays off later with more adoption and less support effort per user.

Stenberg highlights what he’s found to be important for documentation: that it be:

-   Stored _with_ the code, for convenience and so updates are kept in sync, but
-   Not _generated_ from the code
-   Filled with as many examples as possible
-   Documenting every interface
-   Easily accessible and browsed, and
-   Easy to contribute to.

Stenberg then describes work he’s doing to improve the documentation of curl/libcurl, including constantly iterating, adding examples, and generating some simple automated checks for consistency and making sure cross-references stay current.
