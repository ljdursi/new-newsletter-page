[Don’t Worry, You’re Not Wasting Your Mentor’s Time](https://larahogan.me/blog/youre-not-wasting-your-mentors-time/) - Lara Hogan

Can’t agree with Hogan’s post enough. It’s worth finding mentors (*multiple* mentors, who have different areas of expertise) and consulting them often.  I have a few semi-regular calls with research computing team leads, mentors, and others who sometimes have questions or are looking for advice.  It’s a joy to speak with them.  I sometimes offer perspectives or insights, and some fraction of what I share ends up being useful, but I get at least as much from these exchanges as I give.

We’re part of a wide, multidisciplinary community with diverse expertise and experience.  Make use of it!  Talk to local institutional or regional colleagues, send questions to the community by replying here, or join #reseach-computing-and-data in the [Rands Leadership Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/).  Leadership can get lonely, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
