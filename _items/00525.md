[Simple Burnout Triage](https://benmccormick.org/2020/08/31/simple-burnout-triage) - Ben McCormick

McCormick suggests one simple question for your team members to make sure they're not edging towards burnout:

> If you take the pace & quality of the last 2 months of your life and repeated it again and again, how long would you be able to sustain it?

If you get an answer ranging from "I could make this work, but.." to "I can't go on like this", then that raises increasingly serious red flags. The only non-worrying answer to this question is something along the lines of a genuine "oh no, this is good, I can do this indefinitely".
