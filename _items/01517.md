[How New Managers Fail Individual Contributors](https://skamille.medium.com/how-new-managers-fail-individual-contributors-839a13bda1c5) - Camille Fournier

Fournier has coached a lot of managers, and she shares some common failure modes of new managers:

1. Doing all the technical design work yourself
2. Doing all the project management yourself - your team members will need to learn those skills as they advance
3. Neglecting to give feedback
4. Hoarding information - intentionally or unintentionally
5. Focussing on the their own output and not that of the team
