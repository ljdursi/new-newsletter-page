[6 Tips on How to Say No To Customers](https://www.intercom.com/blog/say-no-to-customers/) - Sharon Moorhouse, Intercom

We work closely with researchers, and that can make it hard to say no to a feature request.  This article walks through the process, which is normally pretty routine but can run the risk of leaving hurt feelings.   The tips most relevant to us are:

* Explain why
* Involve the (researcher) in finding another solution
* Focus on the job to be done, not the `no'
* Understand both sides
* It's ok to lose a user

Of course, to say no (or even worse, yes!) to a change request from a user can really get you in trouble if you don't have a clear picture of where the product is going, what its purpose is, and what is in and out of scope.  Mathais Meyer writes about [drafting such a strategy](https://www.paperplanes.de/2020/1/31/on-drafting-an-engineering-strategy.html) when coming in to a team for the first time; there are also approaches for more rigorously deciding what decisions to take with [data and experiments](https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-driven-decision-product-management/).  Whether it comes from those approaches or from an original product vision, saying yes and no to suggestions is a lot easier when you know where you're going.
