[Data project checklist](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/07/data-questionnaire/) <br/>
[How should I structure my data team? A look inside HubSpot, Away, M.M. LaFleur, and more](https://blog.getdbt.com/data-team-structure-examples/)

A lot of organizations are setting up data science teams - these teams are analogous to other sorts of R&D computing teams, but these efforts are (a) everywhere and (b) involve both a lot more money on the line and a lot less institutional inertia than is the case when we’re setting up or managing an HPC centre.

While the answers some organizations come up with may not be necessarily widely applicable elsewhere, a lot of the *questions* being asked really are.   The second link asks some big picture questions (but doesn’t really get into their consequences, which is a sham) - centralized vs distributed?  Where organizationally?   Reporting to whom?  What’s the role?

The first link, a data project (and team) checklist, gets finer grained.  How is work for [R&D computing team members] selected and allocated?  What skills exist in the org currently?
