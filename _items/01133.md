[Building an SRE Team? How to Hire, Assess, & Manage SREs](https://www.blameless.com/blog/sre-team) - Emily Arnott

DevOps and SRE are two sides of a similar coin - bridging the gap between systems and developer teams to do better work faster.  DevOps topics usually involve speeding release cycles, and SRE topics usually focus on improving automation, resiliency, and handling incidents, but there’s a significant degree of overlap.

Even if you aren’t explicitly building an SRE or DevOps team, you can start hiring for these skills and approaches in your regular ops or dev teams and try to take advantage of some of the improved tooling available and emerging best practices about running resilient systems and speeding release of new software.

Arnott’s article talks about the responsibilities of real-world SREs - automating processes, developing tools and infrastructure, creating runbooks, defining incident response steps, and the skills and knowledge you should be looking for in hires who would take on such roles.
