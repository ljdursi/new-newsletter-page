[The Research Computing Teams One-on-one QuickStart Guide](https://www.dursi.ca/post/quickstart-remote-one-on-ones.html) - Jonathan Dursi

Here's a short concrete plan to get started doing one-on-ones with your research computing team.   For each weekday, there’s about 10 minutes of reading and another 10-15 minutes of homework to do to get you started doing one-on-ones with your team starting one week from when you begin. There’s follow-up activities in weeks two and three to take stock, make tweaks, and start thinking about tools that will help.
