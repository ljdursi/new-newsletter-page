[8 Leadership Myths Every Manager Should Know About](https://fellow.app/blog/2020/leadership-myths-every-manager-should-know-about/) - Kate Dagher
A bit basic for long time readers, but it may be useful to send new managers (or someone you're growing towards management), and it's always useful for us to remind ourselves of the basics.

Of the below, I'm still working on not leading everyone the same way, and bringing others into the spotlight. Even though I know intellectually those are the right approaches I still tend to use my default settings on all my team members when busy, and take on a lot of leadership-y tasks like giving talks myself.

- A position will make me a leader
- If I am not hearing anyone complain, everyone must be happy
- I can lead everyone the same way
- Leaders must be extroverts
- Leaders canâ€™t show vulnerability
- Leaders have all the answers
- Great leaders are always in the spotlight
- Great leaders are born, not made
