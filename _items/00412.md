[Tell candidates what to expect from your job interviews](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/30/tell-candidates-what-to-expect-from-your-job-interviews/)  - Julia Evans

The goal of the interview process is to find out if there’s a good match between the job and the candidate; that’s more likely to happen if both the candidate and the interviewers are clear on what the process will be.   Julia Evans points out that it’s straightforward and useful to document the process and communicate it to candidates ahead of time.  The candidate will better know what’s important to the interviewers, and so can communicate their strengths more clearly (as well as being less stressed); the interviewers won’t be winging it and will be able to focus on the important things.  In addition, it makes the hiring unit look much more professional to the candidate.
