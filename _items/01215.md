[Three Core Ideas to Make Remote Work, Work](https://cate.blog/2021/06/28/three-core-ideas-to-make-remote-work-work/) - Cate Huston

Huston has been working remote for over five years, and for those of us getting ready to continue working remote for real and without a pandemic driving it, suggests three key approaches:

- Embrace async.
- Enable autonomy.
- Build connection.

Crucially, these are all team-enhancers for in person teams, too:

- Even for team members all going to the same office, meetings can be hard to schedule, unnecessary meetings are bad, and having written documents outlining how decisions came to be are good and helpful
- Autonomous teams where individuals have significant control can respond faster and more robustly, especially where thereâ€™s documentation to support that
- Office culture helps build connection but even there being intentional about how its done makes the connections stronger
