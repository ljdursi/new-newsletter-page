[Developers spend most of their time figuring the system out](https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/) - Tudor Girba, feenk<br/>
[Writing good code by understanding cognitive load](http://www.davidwhitney.co.uk/Blog/2022/02/02/writing_good_code_by_understanding_cognitive_load) - David Whitney
[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html) - Aleksey Kladov

Girba points us to a recent article: Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, & Li (2018), **[*Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7997917)*,* IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering that looked at 78 professional developers during over 3000 hours of their work and found that 58% of their time was taken up by comprehending a code base; we can infer that work that goes into making code bases more comprehendible improves developer productivity.

Girba’s team has a specific solution to this, but in general, we should work on reducing code’s cognitive load and easing comprehension.   Whitney argues that this is a key consideration:

> There isn’t really such a thing as “good code” – there’s just code that works, that is maintainable, and is simple. There’s a good chance you’ll end up in a better place if you spend time and effort making sure the cognitive load of your application is as low as possible while you code.

Whitney doesn’t argue for any silver bullets; just a nuanced understanding that abstractions and refactoring have costs as well as benefits for comprehension and cognitive load.  Abstractions help by communicating expectations, but moving pieces of code around makes code harder to understand (and in the Xiv *et al* paper, navigation of a code base is next at 24% of developer time!)  It’s a careful and thoughtful piece, and doesn’t lend itself to a short summary; it’s worth reading if the topic interests you.

Kladov makes a simple and implementable pitch for open source (and presumably proprietary) code bases as soon as they start hitting 10k lines of code - along with a README and CONTRIBUTING document, add an ARCHITECTURE document which spells out big picture components, boundaries between components, invariants within components, and cross-cutting concerns.
