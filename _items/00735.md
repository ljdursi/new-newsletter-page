[Blogging your research: Tips for getting started](https://www.scholcommlab.ca/2020/11/23/blogging-your-research-tips-for-getting-started/) - Alice Fleerackers, ScholCommBlog

Fleerackers’ post is aimed at researchers but works equally well for us in research computing.  It starts off with an important point - not every blog post needs to be a 1500 word feature.  It could be a summary of a paper or conference session, a Q&A/interview post; anything that makes the audience more informed about your groups work than it was before.

The decision for where to blog is normally easier for our teams - we generally have a website (but getting posts put elsewhere is good too - like the [US-RSE blog aggregator](http://us-rse.org/blog/) or guest posts on relevant sites), and then set some kind of reasonable schedule.  The most important thing about the schedule (IMHO) is that it’s realistic - routine posts, even spaced apart by a couple months, is better than a flurry of over-ambitious posting followed by exhaustion and abandonment.
