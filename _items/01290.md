[Ten simple rules for teaching applied programming in an authentic and immersive online environment](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1009184) - Frances Hooley, Peter J. Freeman, Angela C. Davies, PLoS Comp Bio

This is a nice set of recommendations of teaching long-form courses online.  The lessons come from the authors’ experiences teaching a masters degree and a postgraduate certificate in clinical bioinformatics in particular, but its recommendations should apply quite broadly to teaching researchers computing skills, and fall under:

- Teaching - they emphasize the pedagogy quite a bit, especially important in online teaching
- Applied practice - bringing everything to the work the learners want to do, and incorporating a community of practice amongst the learners - so not just hub-and-spokes teacher-to-learners, but much peer work; and
- The teaching team - teach with a team approach.

When the “ten simple rules” format fails it’s because it degenerates into a laundry list (which perversely is much easier for me to summarize).  Here it’s a very nicely put together and well thought out paper on teaching semester- or year-long research computing courses for researchers or practitioners, and if that interests you it’s worth reading.
