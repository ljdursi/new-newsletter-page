[The Case for ‘Center Class’ HPC: Think Tank Calls for $10B Fed Funding over Five Years](https://insidehpc.com/2020/12/the-case-for-center-class-hpc-think-tank-calls-for-10b-fed-funding-over-five-years/)

For those who haven't seen the Centre for Data Innovation's [report](https://www2.datainnovation.org/2020-how-the-united-states-can-increase-access-to-supercomputing.pdf) advocating tripling NSF's funding for university HPC centres, the report and the arguments therein may be useful for your own internal advocacy efforts.
