[Why Asking for Advice Is More Effective Than Asking for Feedback](https://hbr.org/2019/09/why-asking-for-advice-is-more-effective-than-asking-for-feedback) - Jaewon Yoon , Hayley Blunden, Ariella Kristal and Ashley Whillans

A nice older article that crossed my desk again arguing that you'll get more open and useful input from a broader range of people people by asking for "advice" than "feedback". As always, you don't need to follow every piece of advice you get, but you should at least take the advice seriously enough to consider.
