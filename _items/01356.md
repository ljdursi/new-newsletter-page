[Software Development Waste](https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/08/29/software-development-waste.html) - Greg Wilson, It Will Never Work in Theory
[Software Development Waste](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7985656) - Todd Sedano, Paul Ralph & Cécile Péraire, ICSE 2017

Wilson briefly summarizes a paper by Sedano, Ralph, and Péraire, who looked at eight software development projects at Pivotal, a software development company, for 2 years and five months, interviewed team members, and analyzed retrospectives. They identified nine broad categories of wasted time and/or effort in the projects:

- Building the wrong feature or product
- Mismanaging the backlog
- Having to re-do work
- Implementing unnecessarily complex solutions
- Extraneous cognitive load (from technical debt, large/complex stories, poor tools/code, etc)
- Psychological stress
- Waiting
- Knowledge loss, and
- Ineffective communication

These will likely sound familiar.  Note too that other than cognitive load from technical debt, these are all process issues, not technical ones.
