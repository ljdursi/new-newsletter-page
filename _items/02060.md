[How to Run an Organized Town Hall Meeting](https://fellow.app/blog/meetings/how-to-run-an-organized-town-hall-meeting/) - Alexandria Hewko, Fellow

Town Halls are a pretty common format in our discipline, and… they’re often not great.  They’re ad-hoc, mostly prepared talks, and so generally not super well-received (and, thus, not generally well-attended).  Why bother if you can read the slides and the Q&A afterwards, right?  We’re all busy.

Hewko gives some advice for running a town hall which is actually a community event rather than a broadcast from HQ:

- Have a recurring meeting cadence
- Have focussed objectives - what is the *purpose* of the series?  And of this episode?
- *Collaboratively* create an agenda
- Record the meetings
- Have a facilitator keep the schedule and encourage participation
- Share new updates - don’t rehash the same stuff.  People can watch the recordings for previous episodes.
- Have lots of time for questions
- Gather feedback regularly
