[HPC on OpenStack the good, the bad and the ugly](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/hpc_openstack/) - Ümit Seren<br/>

The FOSDEM 2020 talks are online now and there's a lot of really nice work presented.  In the HPC, Big Data, and and Data Science track, this good- and bad-news overview of setting up multiple HPC infrastructures on an on-prem OpenStack deployment to take advantage of the reconfigurability between environments.  It's a great talk, and highlights the downsides (the huge complexity of OpenStack) and the upsides (the configurability).

That talk brings up the issue of testing Infrastructure-as-a-Code, but the talk [Infrastructure testing, it's a real thing!](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/infratesting/) by the aptly-named Paul Stack goes into that issue in more detail.  How do you do CI/CD when your "deploys" are infrastructure?
