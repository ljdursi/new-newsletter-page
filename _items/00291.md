[Remote brainstorming for regular humans](https://bartekci.substack.com/p/remote-brainstorming-for-regular) - Bartek Ciszkowski

Whiteboarding and brainstorming are harder to do when the team is distributed.  Here are some suggestions for Ciszkowski on how to do distributed brainstorming:

* Do it in ~20 minute chunks with 5 minute breaks
* Use a simple white boarding tool (Ciszkowski suggests [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) which I hadn’t seen before) or even just a screenshared google doc to record responses.  That way people can visualize connections between ideas to trigger new ideas.
* Periodically restate to your objectives to keep the brainstorming on track.
* Make sure everyone is chiming in.

I’ll just add something that’s not unique to distributed brainstorming: **ban** commenting on the ideas raised (especially critiques!)  You are aiming for lots of ideas first.  Only after idea-gathering is complete is it time for distillation and evaluation.
