[Open Source Update: School of Software Reliability Engineering (SRE)](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/open-source-update--school-of-sre) - LinkedIn Engineering

LInkedIn has updated its School of SRE materials for new hires or those looking to move into SRE.  Even if your systems team isnâ€™t thinking about moving to FAANG-style SRE operations, the basics covered in the material cover a nice range of dev-ops style development, deployment, design, monitoring, and securing of web applications.
