[Mentored Sprints Community Handbook](https://github.com/pycon-mentored-sprints/community-handbook) - Tania Allard and Cheuk Ting Ho

This is really interesting.  Is someone on your team working on a community software project and has been thinking about a (now virtual) hackathon or community sprint with other members of the community?  This very detailed handbook discusses how to organize and run such an effort.
