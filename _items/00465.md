[My Screencasting Workflow](https://dev.to/laurieontech/my-screencasting-workflow-l87) - Laurie Barth

Screencasts can be very useful for training materials. Very experienced screen caster Laurie Barth offers her workflow here. Barth records the screencast without audio, then adds annotations, and only when after that does she record an audio trac narrating it. That extra step seems like it would take extra time, but I've tried the whole narrating-while-typing thing before and it's pretty hard and took either extra takes or living with lots of "umms". I'll try this next time.
