[Guides for Managers](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/guides-managers) - Software Sustainability Institute

This is a resource I hadn’t seen until [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io) pointed it out - a collection of guides for research software development managers, including [starting](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/starting-community-taking-your-software-world) and [improving](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/building-better-community) a community for your product, recruiting a [champion](http://software.ac.uk/resources/guides/recruiting-champions-your-project) or [student developers](http://software.ac.uk/resources/guides/recruiting-champions-your-project), funding [software](https://www.software.ac.uk/how-fund-research-software-development) and [developers](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/how-write-case-funding-software-developer), and more.  The guides are short and come with links to other resources.  They take a “focus on the basics” approach that readers of this newsletter would likely appreciate.  Overlapping sets of guides for [researchers, managers, and instructors](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides) are also available.
