[The Communicative Value of Using Git Well](https://jeremykun.com/2020/01/14/the-communicative-value-of-using-git-well/) - Jeremy Kun

I’ve mentioned before several of [Chelsea Troy](https://chelseatroy.com)’s articles on code review as a sort of asynchronous pair programming, with the benefits both of better quality code and knowledge transfer.   In this article, Kun talks about crafting code changes into meaningful commits and PRs exactly to enhance that communication and knowledge transfer.
