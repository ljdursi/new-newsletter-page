[A set of Common Software Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria for Research Projects](https://indigo-dc.github.io/sqa-baseline/) - Orviz, Lopez, Duma, David, Gomez, and Donvito

Coming out of the [EOSC Synergy](https://www.eosc-synergy.eu) effort, an extensive checklist of criteria for "production strength" research code, to be *e.g.* deployed as a service to communities in the INDIGO Data Cloud. The criteria are broken down into categories:

- Licensing
- Code Workflow
- Code Management
- Code Style
- Code Metadata
- Unit Testing
- Functional Testing
- Integration Testing
- Documentation
- Security
- Code Review
- Automated Deployment

In most areas the actual recommendations aren't that opinionated - e.g. processes must exist and be documented but they aren't generally specified. This makes sense for a field as broad as research computing.

I haven't seen such a comprehensive list before; this is a good conversation starting point conversation for any mature research software product.
