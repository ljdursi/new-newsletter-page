[How to Get Your Team to Challenge Your Ideas](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-get-your-team-to-speak-up-4d403bfc10c9) - Dave Bailey

We’ve talked before about the importance of having your team being comfortable to disagree with you and offer alternative suggestions.  One thing I like here is two sets of suggestions, depending on whether you tend towards over- or under-assertiveness:

For the typically over-assertive

1. Adopt the question reflex.
2. Aim for balance in hearing everyone speak.
3. Avoid generalization.

For the typically under-assertive

1. Over-prepare.
2. Learn some facilitation techniques/helpful phrass
3. Be vulnerable.

Confusingly, I tend towards a bit of both — overassertive in group settings like meetings, and underassertive when speaking one-on-one with individual team members — so this breakdown that I can use contextually is helpful.
