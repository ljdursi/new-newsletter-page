[Renegotiating your first vendor contract](https://lethain.com/renegotiate-first-vendor-contract/) - Will Larson

Eventually we all have to negotiate or renegotiate our first contract with vendors.  This short article wonâ€™t give any secrets that will win you huge concessions.  It will hopefully make the process less stressful by providing a game plan and by setting some realistic expectations, on their side (your vendor wants money, and is willing to make some *small* trades on the margins for the exact amount of money, but not much) and yours (you should absolutely be able to assume decreasing marginal costs, reasonable timelines, and to see issues seen previously addressed).
