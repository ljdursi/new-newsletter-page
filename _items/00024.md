[Hire Good Writers](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths), "Getting Real", Basecamp

A short, thought provoking section from an interesting write up on building web applications by Basecamp.

"If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer.... Good writers know how to communicate.  They make things easy to understand.  They can put themselves in someone elses' shoes.  They know what to omit.  They think clearly.  And those are qualities you need."

Breaking ties when hiring is genuinely hard, and I'm going to take this suggestion seriously when the next opportunity rolls around.
