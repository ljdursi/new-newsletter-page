[Bucketing your time](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/bucketing-your-time) - James Stanier, The Engineering Manager

We've talked about organizing tasks in buckets before - In [Issue 37](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/a33145e9-9016-4642-9d01-fb1ac868fa68) I've mentioned my experiments with trello, and in [Issue 39](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/26967bc4-8d8e-4f76-b86f-4fd7d94590be) I linked to an [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2) about having a "dashboard" that covers both issues, things to keep an eye on, and future-looking work.

This is a nice article about why I find these approaches work well for me - it's a way of systematizing the discipline of not just getting lost in the day-to-day while also highlighting important-but-not-urgent tasks at a variety of timescales. If this something that you wrestle with too, this is a nice article to read. I've certainly found being able to keep track of "today/this week/coming month/coming quarter" tasks useful to keep my eye on the ball. Stanier also distinguishes between recurring tasks and one-off tasks, as a way of showing what tasks would be more valuable to delegate.
