[Two Kinds of Code Review](https://matklad.github.io//2021/01/03/two-kinds-of-code-review.html) - Aleksey Kladov

This is another good article of a number we've seen here on the topic of code review as asynchronous pair programming, a way of sharing knowledge both ways - about the code itself but also about expectations and goals of the team. From the article:

- "One goal of a review process is good code."
- "Another goal of a review is good coders."
