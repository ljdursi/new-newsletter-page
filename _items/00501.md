[The documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com) - Divio

The Divio page is a nice set of pages talking about a systematic way to think about various kinds of documentation - tutorials, explanation, reference, and how-to guides - as documents meeting different needs, along two different axes: when studying vs when working, and providing practical vs theoretical knowledge. For our systems, our software, our curated data sets, really all of the outputs of research computing, we need these kinds of documentation, and it's not enough to provide one of those kinds and not the other.

It looks like a lot of pages but it's a relatively short read, and if you feel like you need a more systematic approach to some of your product's documentation, I think it's worthwhile.
