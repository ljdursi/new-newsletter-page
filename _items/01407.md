Beard provides a LaTeX template for Gebru *et al’s* suggested “Datasheets for Data sets”, a human readable high level description of a dataset - not a data dictionary, but describing the reason the data set exists, how data was collected, what preprocessing/cleaning/labeling was done if any, how or if maintenance will be done, what uses the dataset has been put to, and more.
