[Run your day, don’t let the day run you](https://www.kahlillechelt.com/blog/run-your-day-dont-let-the-day-run-you/) - Kahlil Lechelt

A manager or leads’ day in research computing is much busier and filled with a wider variety of demands than we’re used to as an IC.  It’s vital to maintain some sort of control over the tasks you’re working on.   Lechelt gives good advice:

- Everything goes in a task list - email is not the place to store to-dos.
- Have a small list of things you *will* get done today, leaving slack in the schedule for things that come up.
- Have your calendar be the single source of truth.
- You’ll slip somtimes.  It happens.  You’ll abandon your task list, get stuck in fire-fighting, stop putting work activities on your calendar.  Accept it and start back where you left off.
