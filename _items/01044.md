[A thorough team guide to RFCs](https://leaddev.com/technical-decision-making/thorough-team-guide-rfcs) - Juan Pablo Buriticá

We’ve written before about design documents architectural decision logs (*e.g.* [#33](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/e6e2a188-35b2-4d78-9cca-d20d078c7c74)) and using collaboration around documents as a form of asynchronous meeting (*e.g.* [#49](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/4bc6f8d2-8d34-4559-ba31-03c6f1459446)).  Usually the thinking is that someone in charge has initiated the document.  Buriticá writes about team member-initiated requests for comments as a proposal for a change or the creation of something new, which can then go through a comments phase like a PR, and an approval phase where whatever decision making process is appropriate plays out and people get to work implementing the proposal.  In this respect it’s like a Python [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) or a W3C RFC.

This approach is very consistent with a model of delegating to and developing your team members - turning every team member into a technical leader by having them propose, revise, and gain support for technical directions in their area of expertise.
