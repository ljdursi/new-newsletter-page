[Delegation is a superpower](https://leaddev.com/process/delegation-superpower) - Caitlin Hudon, Lead Dev

It’s true!  But, superpowers sometimes take some practicing to use effectively.

I personally am pretty good at the mechanics of delegating *when I think to do it*, but too often find myself taking on a responsibility so as not to bother anyone else with it, or because only I can do it (well, yes, if no one else gets a chance to learn how to, I guess I am the only one who can do it).

The ending year is a good time to reflect on things you’ve spent time on to see if they could usefully be given to someone else as a welcome growth opportunity.   Hudon encourages us to see a task being delegatable by default:

- Is this task something that only I am uniquely able to do [because of the role power of my job]?  - Ok, fine, I can’t delegate it
- Do I need to perform this task because of a limiting constraint (for example, you’re running out of time or only you understand the context)? - Do it this time, but start laying the groundwork to delegate it next time
- Should I be the person responsible for this task, or is there someone better suited? - Delgate it
