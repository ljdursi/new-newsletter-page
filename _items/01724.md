[Tech 1-on-1 ideas & scripts](https://1on1s.robwhelan.com) - Rob Whelan

Here are some scripts or ideas for discussions for one-on-one meetings with team members, broken up into four categories of situations:

- Nothing from me - skip this one?
- Everything is (really) fine
- This is fine (on fire)
- Something has to change

They’re short reads but useful for clarifying your thinking before going into one-on-ones; certainly for new managers and it’s always worth refreshing on the basics.
