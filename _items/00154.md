[5 Best Practices on Nailing Postmortems](https://www.blameless.com/5-best-practices-nailing-postmortems/) - Hannah Culver, Blameless

We’ve started doing incident reports - sort of baby postmortems - in our project, which has been an extremely useful practice in growing more discipline about how issues with availability or security are reported, distributed, and dealt with.  It also gives us a library of materials that we can look through to identify any patterns that appear.

This article talks about some best practices for running postmortem processes --
- Use visuals
- Be a historian - use timelines, but sparingly
- Publish promptly - the faster, the more accurate the recollections
- Be blameless:
    - People are not points of failure.
    - Everyone on the team is working with good intentions.
    - Failure will happen.
- Tell a story

I think we’re pretty good with the blameless/tell a story parts in our incident but the prompt publishing has been a problem - we still need to improve the process, and right now I’m a huge bottleneck - and we’re not using visuals just yet.
