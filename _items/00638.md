[Do Your Employees Feel Safe Reporting Abuse and Discrimination?](https://hbr.org/2020/10/do-your-employees-feel-safe-reporting-abuse-and-discrimination) - Lily Zheng, HBR

If we want to support our employees, especially team members who experience sexism or racism, we need to make sure they have opportunities to report that abuse and discrimination. Although our teams are typically small, we're often in large institutions which have mechanisms that can help, such as employee assistance plans (EAP), explicit offices for EDI or that handle sexual harassment or racial discrimination complaints, or ombudsman offices. It's our responsibility to know what those resources are an to make it clear that they're available to employees.

We also have to take any complaints that any of our team members trust us with extremely seriously, and to take their needs into account when deciding how to proceed.
