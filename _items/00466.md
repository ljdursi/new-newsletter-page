[Building digital workforce capacity and skills for data-intensive science](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/building-digital-workforce-capacity-and-skills-for-data-intensive-science_e08aa3bb-en) - OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers

This white paper takes a careful look at to what the workforce needs will be to enable data-intensive science in both the public and private sectors. They take a close look at 13 case studies, and it's worth reading if you're interested - it's only about 40 pages. Maybe most crucially, a key take-away of the report is:

> There is a need for both digitally skilled researchers [..] and a variety of professional research support staff, **including data stewards and research software engineers.**

This isn't surprising but as just the latest calls for professional recognition of the sort of work research computing staff performs, it's good to see. Also called for are career ladders for such staff within Universities and other research institutions.
