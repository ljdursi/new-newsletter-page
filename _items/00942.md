[Thoughts on Engineering Management](https://benmccormick.org/engineering-management-thoughts) - Ben McCormick

McCormick writes a series of five articles on technical computing management.  The broad topics won’t be a huge surprise to readers, but they’re good reads in that they’re all in a very coherent voice and philosophy:

- [What EMs do](https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/18/what-do-ems-do) - focussing on facilitating information flow, driving progress forward, and building a sustainably productive team - and that all of those are time consuming
- [Choosing what to work on](https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/21/ems-choosing-what-to-work-on) - which does a good job of separating the focus from the “rhythms” of certain kinds of routine but important work like one-on-ones, sprint rituals, etc that keep things running smoothly, and the prioritizing the rest on high-leverage work that has the most impact.  “Stay Sane, Keep Your Integrity, and Remember That People Matter The Most” is probably as good a single line of management advice as any I’ve heard;
- [Handling Accountability](https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/23/ems-handling-accountability) as a manager, which in our first managerial jobs is very different than the kinds of accountabilities we’re used to
- [How to delegate](https://benmccormick.org/2021/02/26/ems-how-to-delegate) - and
- [How to give feedback](https://benmccormick.org/2021/03/07/ems-how-to-give-feedback) - emphasizing candor and the “situation, behaviour, impact” model.
