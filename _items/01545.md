[How To Produce a Webinar Series](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/Webinar-Process) - Osni Marques *et al.*, HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinar Series

The Exascale Computing Project has [hosted](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 58 roughly monthly webinars on “HPC Best Practices”, so they’ve gotten it down to more or less a science now.  In this github repo, the organizers have a [check list](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/Webinar-Process/blob/master/checklist.md), a [guidance email](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/Webinar-Process/blob/master/guidance.md) to presenters, and a [paper](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/Webinar-Process/blob/master/2019_JOCSE.pdf) from 2019 describing their experiences.  This might be a good starting point if your group or community wanted to start organizing such a series.
