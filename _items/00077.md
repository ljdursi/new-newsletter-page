[How to Coach Employees?  Ask these One-on-One Meeting Questions](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/02/19/how-to-coach-employees-ask-these-1-on-1-meeting-questions/) - Claire Lew, KnowYourTeam<br/>

All of the above approaches require knowing your team members well - how well they’re doing what they do now, what they’d like to do next, and where they have untapped strengths.  Regular one-on-ones, where the focus is on the team member and not on you or on status updates, are by far the best tool we have to learn these things and to build strong working relationships.

Claire Lew’s post focuses specifically on questions around coaching team members so you can help their skill and career development, broken into four categories: their perception of the current state, the ideal outcome of where they need to be, what they are most motivated by, and what’s holding them back.

The resource from peoplebox is a list of 500 (!!) one-on-one questions (plus alternates if you don’t like the wording) that could be useful to skim through occasionally to see if there are any topics that you haven’t been covering but maybe you might want to in the future.
