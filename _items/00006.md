[Second thoughts on Proper Citation Guidance for Software Developers](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2019/12/20/thoughts-on-citation-guidance-for-developers/)

A good recent blog post on the pros and cons of different approaches to software citation by Daniel S. Katz, who’s thought about this a lot.  Some key points: any method is going to take extra work by *someone*; there may not be a one-size-fits all approach; and in the end, code just isn’t the same as a paper (amongst other things, there’s no one point at which it’s done).  Daniel ends the post leaning tentatively towards recommending [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) IDs.
