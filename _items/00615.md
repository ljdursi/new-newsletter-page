[Help, I’m a Research Computing Manager!](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/SORSE/) - Jonathan Dursi, SORSE event

At the really nicely run [SORSE event](https://sorse.github.io/programme/talks/event-005) last week, I gave my 10 minute pitch that research computing actually prepares you pretty well for the advanced skills managing needs, we just need to shore up the basics. The basics I covered won't be of a surprise to any readers - one-on-ones, feedback, delegation.

The talk and the resources I recommended are on the page; also, I updated my one-on-ones quickstart guide ([PDF](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.pdf), [epub](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.epub)) that had been written at the start of the pandemic to start them fast fast fast to instead start them up at a more normal pace.

The talk started with a poll - what are the problems the (mostly new or not-yet started) managers see in research software projects? Not surprisingly, they were almost overwhelmingly people or institutional issues:

| Fraction of respondents | Problem                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 60%                     | Staffing                                          |
| 50%                     | Funding                                           |
| 47.5%                   | Shifting needs/unclear requirements               |
| 42.5%                   | Poor communications with stakeholders             |
| 30.0%                   | Getting poeple in agreement on howto move forward |
| 25.0%                   | Poor support from other departments/institutions  |
| 17.5%                   | Technology choices                                |
