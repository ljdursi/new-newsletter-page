[On being "technical" as an engineering manager](https://situated.blog/2020/01/technical-engineering-manager), Sean Voisin

How technical do you have to be to be a technical manager?  I think this blog post has the right answer; "enough", where enough will depend on what your team is doing and what your role is on the team.

You have to be able to make sure the team's doing the right work and progressing satisfactorily, but that's a different *kind* rather than a different *amount* of technical knowledge necessary to actually do the work.  For us it will require a certain level of subject matter/domain science literacy as well as staying on top of what other teams are doing and using to solve nearby problems.
