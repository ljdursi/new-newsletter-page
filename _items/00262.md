[How to expand conflict capacity in times of crisis](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2020/05/how-expand-conflict-capacity-times-crisis)  - Marlene Chism

We’re all tired and stressed right now, and it’s easy under those circumstances for small things to cause conflict where it normally wouldn’t.  This is something that we can work on, but it takes some time and practice.  Pay close attention to things that trigger unhelpful reactions, try to be aware of them as they come up and short-circuit them, and then buy some time saying you’ll get back to them and step away.
