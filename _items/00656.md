[4 Tips for Addressing—and Even Embracing—Tension](https://www.ideo.com/blog/4-tips-for-addressing-and-even-embracing-tension) - Holly Bybee & Lauren Yarmuth

Tension between ideas is good and healthy and normal in technical teams, and Bybee & Yarmuth talk about how to address it and harness it constructively.

- Observe the dynamic
- Give it a name - call it out
- Just start making - Don't try to sort out the tension on some abstract plane, start doing something to make things concrete
- Assume good intent - Keep in your and your team member's minds that it's not idea X vs idea Y, it is the team members vs the problem that you are trying to solve.
