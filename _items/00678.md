[Own Your Feedback (Part 1): Receive Better Feedback by Asking](https://smallbigideas.substack.com/p/own-your-feedback-part-1) - Padmini Pyapali

We've talked about giving feedback to our team members, but we need feedback, too - from our managers, or researcher's we're supporting, or other stakeholders. Pyapali makes some specific recommendations for getting good feedback from others. They all involve asking, and how to ask:

- Be Timely and Specific - you'll get better feedback if you're asking soon after the thing you're asking about, and if you ask specific questions
- Provide a Reason - people will be more willing to answer if you provide a reason - e.g. you're working on some skill or behaviour
- Prepare the Feedback Giver - don't surprise them with the ask, by either giving them a heads up or...
- Persist - if you keep asking for feedback - and receiving it well - people will become increasingly willing to provide good feedback.
