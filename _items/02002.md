[Making The Leap from Individual Contributor to Engineering Manager](https://www.reforge.com/blog/from-ic-to-engineering-manager) - Natalie Rothfels & Doa Jafri, Reforge

Speaking of promoting a team member to manager - Rothfels and Jafri talk about the challenges faced by an individual contributor taking on their first management role, and the skills they need to learn.  I like their discussion of them, binned into five categories:

1. Hone concise, clear, context-driven communication (including bridging communities and having tough conversations)
2. Developing emotional regulation and self-reflection (someone can’t lead others if they’re constantly freaked out)
3. Learn the craft of facilitation for both technical and non-technical discussions (the job now is to make sure the right conversations happen and go well, not necessarily contribute to the conversations)
4. Create and maintain strong organizational systems (from [#110](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0110), you manage processes and lead people)
5. Shift your mindset around progress, ambiguity, and change. (This is a bit easier for those who have worked around research for a while!)

These are a lot of big skills to learn!  New managers or team leads need a lot of support as they go through these changes.
