[Ramadan Mubarak! - Ramadan Tips for Non-Muslim Friends of Muslims](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10VLDK4krL53PPTaDxDDT6C6MQGMA4mrvmcFE4sA_0a0/mobilepresent?slide=id.g35f391192_00) - Fahmida Kamali

Ramadan is here, and Kamali offers some tips for those of us who are non-Muslims to be supportive to and non-weird around their Muslim colleagues during this period of fasting.  As Kamali points out in a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fahmidakamali/status/1379444235221532672?s=20), working from home does **not** make it easier to fast (do _you_ find yourself eating less working from home?) and we could all use a little extra support right now.  In this slide deck, she offers some background and some tips:

- If you’re not fasting, don’t be weird about eating in front of observers - it makes them feel awkward
- Ask about the experience rather than making assumptions
- Sometimes Muslims don’t fast for a number of reasons - don’t pry
- Ask if they need any help or accommodations
- You can participate without fasting - in normal times by joining an Iftar (breaking of the fast), or sharing wealth
- Be understanding and show solidarity
