[OOPS writeups](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/11/21/oops-writeups/) - Lorin Hochstein

Hochstein gives the outline and an explanation as to how his team in Netflix write up “OOPS” reports, essentially incidents that didn’t rise to the level of Incident Response, as a way of learning and sharing knowledge about things that can go wrong in their systems.  It’s a nice article and provides a light-weight model to potentially use.

His outline, blasted verbatim from the article, is below.  I particularly like the sections on contributors/enablers and Mitigators as things that didn’t *cause* the issue but made it better or worse than it would otherwise have been.   If this is of interest to you, or you’re thinking of starting some way of formally writing up “events” that happen in your systems, the article is a short and interesting read.
