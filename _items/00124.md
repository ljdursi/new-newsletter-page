[How to manage one to ones](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/03/16/how-to-manage-one-to-ones/) - Dan Moore, Letters to a New Developer

I’ve shared several posts here about one-on-ones from our point of view as a manger; this one is written as advice to someone starting out as an initial contributor, focusing on what they should be aiming to get out of a one on one.  Whichever side of the conversation you’re on, it’s worth spending some time thinking about what the other person should be aiming to get out of these conversations!  One-on-ones are about the direct report, and this gives some idea about what they might want to be hearing.  Really it’s not too hard to identify with the points made here; they’d be pretty much exactly what we’d want to be covering in one-on-ones with our boss if we had them.
