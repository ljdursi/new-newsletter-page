[The Runbooks Project](https://zwischenzugs.com/2020/06/25/the-runbooks-project/) - Ian Mieli

In an effort to help get people started with runbooks for operations, Ian Miele of Container Soltuions has started an opensource set of runbooks, the [Open Runbooks Project](https://containersolutions.github.io/runbooks/), starting with their own.  Worth checking out as a set of templates, and keeping an eye on as more get added.
