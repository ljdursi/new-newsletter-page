[How to deprioritize tasks, projects, and plans (without feeling like you’re ‘throwing away’ your time and effort)](https://blog.rescuetime.com/how-to-deprioritize/) - Jory MacKay, RescueTime

Focus is all about not doing things - which is tough in a research environment when there are so many interesting and valuable things that you could be doing! MacKay's article summarizes some good strategies for *not* doing the right things.

1. Timeboxing - Set limits on how long you’ll work on a task
2. Create a ‘not to do’ list
3. Use a weekly review to reassess your priorities
4. Isolate only the most impactful elements of important tasks
5. Ask your team, clients, or boss what they think is most important
