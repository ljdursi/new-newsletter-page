[New users generate more exceptions than existing users (in one dataset](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/05/24/new-users-generate-more-exceptions-than-existing-users-in-one-dataset/) - Derek Jones, The Shape Of Code

Not surprising for us in research computing but nice to have it validated with data: new users of software find new ways to trigger software faults.  This is one of the reasons why the transitions that research software goes through — from being used by the creator to being used by friendly users, and then again to being used by a wider community — is so challenging and requires so much retooling.
