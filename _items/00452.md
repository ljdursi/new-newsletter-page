[Testing And Scale](https://thecobraeffect.blogspot.com/2020/07/testing-and-scale.html) - Daniel Bell

This is a short read talking about the difference in the need for testing at the initial, exploratory phase of coding (where detailed testing is brittle and slows you down) as opposed to the stage of development where the code is being used for real things (where *lack* of detailed coding makes the codebase brittle because it can't be easily safely modified). This this is particularly relevant to research software development, where I've argued a [maturity model](https://www.dursi.ca/post/incrementalism-for-scientific-development.html) is a useful way to look at software. (Incidentally, there's an upcoming [SORSE talk](https://sorse.github.io/programme/talks/event-009/) on maturity in social sciences research data services that I'm excited for).
