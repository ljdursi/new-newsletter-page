[Re:Work: Five keys to a successful google team](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)

I think this was circulating again because of a new article of something related that Microsoft did ( [In a Recent Study, Microsoft Found That the Most Successful Teams Share These 5 Traits](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/in-a-recent-study-microsoft-found-that-most-successful-teams-share-these-5-traits.html) ), and it’s not hard to refactor the five traits from one into something that looks like the five factors from the other; these are fairly basic things:

1. Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
2. Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
3. Structure & clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
4. Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
5. Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?

These all comes down to communication and engagement from the manager - from us - which we can help with some basic tools.

Being in research helps us with a few of these: the meaning and impact of our work is much clearer than if were working on some random consumer-facing product.  But we sometimes pay a price on items like structure & clarity or dependability.==
