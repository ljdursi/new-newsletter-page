[A simple framework for software engineering management](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-framework-for-software-engineering-management-f70b216540f2) - Andrei Gridnev

This post describes a nice simple approach to structuring thinking about software development management; three categories of responsibilities

- People management - hiring, team member career development, ensuring people are content and engaged with their work
- Delivery leadership - execution on delivering new work or changes
- Technical system ownership - maintaining the technical systems under your stewardship

and then labelling priority areas under each responsibility with

- issues - things that need to be changed
- ok - things going well but should still be monitored
- ideas/aspirations - things that you'd like to try or change in the future

That makes for a simple "dashboard" of things to keep your efforts focussed on in a simple three-by-three chart:
