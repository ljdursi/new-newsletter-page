[Code Review is Feedback](https://www.linsoftware.com/code-review-is-feedback/) - Linnea Huxford

A reminder that code review isn’t just about the code in question, it’s feedback.  So that means it’s an opportunity to give nudges to inform future behaviours (code submissions), it’s an opportunity to give positive as well as negative feedback, and it’s important that all team member are providing consistent feedback.
