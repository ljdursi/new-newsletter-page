[Mailbag: Building alignment around a new strategy](https://lethain.com/socializing-strategy/) - Will Larson

This was written in the context of setting a technical strategy within a technical organization, but it works just as well in a context where you’re working with stakeholders and researchers about a product or project strategy.

The approach Larson describes will be familiar from the discussion about “change management” and stopping doing things in [#58](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/410ef54d-ef8a-41e0-bf77-b9c06eb612b0) - there’s no way around it, it’s labour- and time-consuming.   You have to first make sure everyone agrees on the problem, then build towards a solution, and shop that around getting input.

Most of us aren’t working with communities of a size where a working group makes sense - it’s our job to put together an initial solution proposal (or a couple of options), then [pre-wire](https://www.manager-tools.com/2007/11/how-to-prewire-a-meeting) that information, iteratively gathering feedback, getting ready for a presentation where a solution is proposed.    But the basic approach is the same.  If it sounds like a  lot of work, it is!  Getting wide agreement about something new, or even worse a change to something old, is genuinely difficult, there’s no way around it.
