[Drawing good architecture diagrams](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/drawing-good-architecture-diagrams) - Toby W, (UK) National Cyber Security Centre

A nice overview of drawing architecture diagrams. The article makes the point that the diagram is about communicating, and if it doesn't communicate the key points of the system to the readers, then it's not succeeding.
I like this advice:

> Start with a basic high level concept diagram which provides a summary. Then create separate diagrams that use different lenses to zoom into the various parts of your system.

Having multiple diagrams of the same system viewed through different "lenses" seems more likely to be a success than trying to cram everything into one diagram.
