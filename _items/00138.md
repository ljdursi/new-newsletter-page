[Moderating Discussions over Video](https://blog.bethcodes.com/moderating-discussions-over-video) - Beth Andres-Beck

Working remotely and communicating online doesn’t really introduce new problems so much as it greatly amplifies exiting problems that can otherwise be papered over with in-person interactions.

Some meetings are pretty straightforward and translate well to online - standups, or team status updates.  But it if you want to have a brainstorming meeting or a meeting to come up with a new solution to a problem - or even choose which problem to solve - rather than just a round table of updates, doing it virtually takes some extra thought.  Moderating those discussions well takes some doing even in person -  our team this week had an opportunity to see some online meetings where this was and wasn’t successfully achieved virtually. (Taking notes on what doesn't go well is a good starting point to running your own meetings better…)

In this article, Andres-Beck takes some lessons from her experience in quite a different environment - from those of her small liberal arts school professors who did a very good job and moderating classroom discussions in the humanities (which are typically much more engaging than lectures in STEM fields).

The whole article is a bullet-point list of things you can straightforwardly do, so I can’t really summarize it; do read it.  Some suggestions that stood out:

- Have the other videos in gallery view, so you keep an eye on if people are engaged
- For up to 10 people I don't bother with raised hands.  For more than that some video tools have a built-in mechanisms: for the rest you can use chat
- Have one person, ideally not a participant, take collaborative notes so everyone else can pay attention
- Establish your facilitation plan up-front and communicate it
- Cover the goal of the specific discussion as well, and frame any expectations
- As much as possible, prompt for specific kinds of comments, rather than using open-ended questions
- People aren't getting the usual signals to stop talking, so don't be shy about interrupting
