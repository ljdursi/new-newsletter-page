[The Final One-on-One: 7 Questions to ask When Offboarding Employees](https://hypercontext.com/blog/meetings/offboarding-meeting) - Anita Chauhan, Hypercontext

If people do leave, we should celebrate that - growth and development and moving to new roles is good and healthy - even if itâ€™s a pain for us.  In addition, a team member leaving can be a good time to get some unvarnished feedback if you've spent the time together building a good working relationship.  Chauhan recommends some questions, including:

- Is there anything we should be aware of as we take over your responsibilites?
- If we could improve, how would we do it?
- Did the job live up to your expectations?
- What was the most enjoyable part of your job?
- What qualities and skills should someone have to be succesful in your role?
- Who do you feel is doing an outstanding job on the team?
