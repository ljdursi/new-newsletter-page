David Boyne

Written for new managers, but it’s always worth revisiting the basics.  David Boyne gives ten items he wishes he knew earlier, with 3-6 specific tips for each:

* Look after yourself
* Plan ahead
* Hold effective meetings
* Communicate effectively
* Make time to learn (especially about management)
* Keep your hand in the day to day work while you can, but…
* Learn to let go
* Have the team improve (retrospectives, data, individual growth)
* Empower and trust the team
* Connect different worlds
