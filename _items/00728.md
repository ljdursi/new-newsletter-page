[Preserving Culture When Someone Leaves the Team](https://anothermarkwood.medium.com/preserving-culture-when-someone-leaves-cfec17690a83) - Mark Wood

Whether people are leaving or joining, as managers we have to be deliberate about the team we’re helping build.   Wood points out that when someone leaves, you have the opportunity and responsibility to think about what behaviours that person had that shaped the team, and what you’ll do to replace those - asking other people (maybe including yourself) to do some of some of those things to fill in the gap, hiring someone who will do similar things.  You also have the opportunity to think about what behaviours make sense to end or change and take steps there, too.
