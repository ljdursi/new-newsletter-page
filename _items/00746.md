[High level overview of how Australian Research Data Commons is viewing Research Software as a First Class Object](https://mobile.twitter.com/TomHoneyman3/status/1333539593694560257) - Tom Honeyman on Twitter

This is a really interesting diagram of how ARDC is thinking of research software:

The approach is I think the right one, and one [I've advocated before](https://www.dursi.ca/post/incrementalism-for-scientific-development.html); taking a path-to-maturity model approach, where the levels are (in their terms, with my interpretations):

- Reveal: supporting methods development - making sure the code that goes with a paper gets on github (or wherever), is documented and useable, etc. The "Long tail" of research software development
- Transform: Turning that initial code into something that can be run by others
- Sustain: Turning that code into research infrastructure itself - keeping it maintained, widely useable.

I think of this as "proof of concept; prototype; production". They're very different stages. More controversially, I think of only the first, proof of concept, as actually being a research output; prototype and production are about turning that research output into a research input.
