[Picking problems for programming interviews](https://lethain.com//appropriate-programming-problems/) - Will Larson

If you do do coding as part of your interviews, itâ€™s tough to find something that is relevant, hard enough to successfully distinguish between candidates, but easy enough to be doable.  Here Larson plays with a few examples (one of which is a particular kind of data munging: something broadly relevant to our needs).  His suggestions are to aim for problems that:

- Support simple initial solutions and compounding requirements
- Are solvable with a few dozen lines of code
- Require algorithmic thinking but not knowing a specific algorithm
- Don't require juggling numerous variables in your head
- Does support debugging and evolving the code
- Are not domain specific to [unjustly: LJD] advantage arbitrary experience
- Require writing actual code in language of their choice
- Are done in a real code editor
