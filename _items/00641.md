[Things I Learned from Looking at 500 Research Computing Manager Jobs over 10 Months](https://www.dursi.ca/post/jobs_managing_research_computing_teams.html) - Jonathan Dursi (me)

As you know, the newsletter has always had a section on job postings for leads and managers of research computing teams, and since June I've also been keeping them on a [job board](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/jobboard/). We've now hit 500 jobs that were posted at one time or another, so I thought I'd summarize the patterns I've seen:

- There are a lot of jobs out there for people managing research computing teams.
- There are certainly many more I’m missing.
- Research computing teams are broadening, and so is the need for managers.
- Research data management is increasingly employable.
- “Traditional” research computing team management jobs remain, and they take forever to fill.
- Despite the talk of RSE units, many research computing jobs within academic institutions are still lone outposts, embedded in a particular project.
