[Advancing the Workforce That Supports Computationally and Data Intensive Research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492830) - Patrick Schmitz, Scott Yockel, Claire Mizumoto, Thomas Cheatham, Dana Brunson, Computing in Science and Engineering

In [#79](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0079) we mentioned an NSF grant on Strategic Tools, Practices, and Professional Development for Advancing Research Computing and Data.  In this paper, the investigators give a great overview of the need for research computing and data personnel, real professional development opportunities, the very different requirements from higher ed IT, and the need for a career ladder on the individual contributor path.  Newsletter readers won’t be surprised by the thrust of the paper, but it may be very useful for advocating, and it’s worth a read - there are great tidbits, *e.g.:*

> researchers in the social sciences, for example, are using as much computing resources as physicists did ten years ago

> In an April 2017, CaRCC survey of RCD professionals at over 150 universities, colleges, and
> government labs, professional development was identified as the top priority.

I greatly like the approach taken here of considering research computing and data as a whole with multiple facets.  And there’s even a call for education managers for both staff *and managers*!
