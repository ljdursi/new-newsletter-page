[The lettuce pact: The ultimate hack for giving difficult feedback](https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/lettuce-pact-for-difficult-feedback) - Brennan McEachran, Hypercontext

If you’re struggling to figure out how to improve your team’s frank but kind feedback to each other, McEachran has a suggestion.  Riffing off a [discussion from the Radical Candor team](https://www.radicalcandor.com/video-spinach-teeth/), the suggestion is to make things concrete, with a personally embarrassing but minor situation like someone about to give a talk with spinach between their teeth.  They clearly have a right to be told, and there’s clearly better and worse ways to share it with the person, but it’s hard to know how to bring it up.  It’s a good way to frame the discussion of giving feedback.

I think McEachran takes this too far and not far enough - a formal agreement 1:1 with each team member, but focussing only on personally embarrassing feedback rather than more generally telling someone that they’re not meeting an expectation - but nonetheless it may be a useful starting point for discussing feedback within your team.
