[How to Run Effective 1:1s](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-run-effective-11s-) - Luca Rossi<br/>
[The big guide to One on Ones (1:1s) for Managers](https://amattn.com/p/the_big_guide_to_one_on_ones_1_1s_for_managers.html) - Matt Nunogawa

It’s always good to refresh the basics, especially when hearing from someone new.

Rossi emphasizes, correctly in my opinion, the relationship-maintenance aspect of one-on-ones - maintaining the lines of communication is at least as important as what is communicated in any particular one-on-one.  He also has this nice image about how having a scheduled opportunity to touch base frequently makes it much easier to make nudges and keep things on course than having less-frequent one-on-ones (or worse, not having them at all):

![Correcting problems with frequent one-on-ones](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6813741e-0e90-4c84-928b-8a8b342a5a7a_1878x1252.png)

Both are good short reads, especially if you’re not already doing routine one-on-ones.
