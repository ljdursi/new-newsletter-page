[Attitudes toward Change and Transformational Leadership: A Longitudinal Study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697017.2020.1758529) - Matthew David Henricks, Michael Young & E. James Kehoe, *J. Change Management*

There’s a lot of people who spend their careers studying how workplaces work.  I don’t think most of the management literature percolates into STEM fields — the papers look funny.  They’re full of impenetrable jargon (unlike our normal completely buzzword-free reading) and the text seems impossibly fluffy compared to dense STEM work (but, well, people’s behaviour doesn’t lend itself to formulae and small dense sentences).

This is a longitudindal study that probably aligns with you already believe, but it’s worth highlighting - you absolutely can change culture or practices in a team or larger organization, but you can’t do it by having a single event and then putting up some posters.  It takes time and sustained effort.  People systems are like large ships; it’s hard to get them to change course, but once actually you get them turning they have a lot of momentum.
