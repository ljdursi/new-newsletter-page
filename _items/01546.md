[Coordination models - tools for getting groups to work well together](https://www.rubick.com/coordination-models/) - Jade Rubick

Rubick is slowly writing a pretty impressive compendium of coordination models within but also across that he’s seen work, how to make them work, and their tradeoffs.  Several of them are extremely relevant to research computing and data;

- [Service provider](https://www.rubick.com/service-provider-model/)
- Consultant (not yet written)
- [Liaison](https://www.rubick.com/liaison-model/)
- [Embedded](https://www.rubick.com/embedded-model/)
- Community of practice

There was a lot of discussion early on in the newsletter about centralized vs embedded RSE or data science teams; it’s nice to see someone thoughtfully writing up a more detailed overview of the kinds of coordination models, with frank looks at their failure modes.
