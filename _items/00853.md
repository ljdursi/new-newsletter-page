[Writing Is One of the Best Things You Can Invest In, as a Software Engineer. The More Experienced People Become, the More They Tend to Realize This.](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1353661833236926470) - Gergely Ortoz

Speaking of non-technical skills being underrepresented in technical job descriptions...
Communicating well is absolutely essential part of a job in any interdisciplinary endeavour like research computing, and written communication is becoming absolutely vital as teams go remote. That doesn't necessarily mean particularly good grammar or vocabulary - we're an international community, many in our community are ESL, and those are things that can be cleaned up with tooling support afterwards. But being able to logically make a point, express an argument, or describe a process is essential.

In this twitter thread, Orosz lists a number of resources attempting to convince the reader of this point, and other resources that he feels can be used to help improve written communication skills.
