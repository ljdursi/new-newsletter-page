[A guide to quarterly planning (plus a template)](https://hypercontext.com/blog/meetings/quarterly-planning-meeting-agenda) - Nicole Kahansky, Hypercontext

Kahansky gives an outline for a quarterly planning meeting.  Quarterly is an excellent cadence for planning (and even performance reviews) for a lot of research computing teams; long enough between meetings that meaningful amounts of work can be done, but short enough to be able to react to our always-changing environment and needs.   Kahansky outlines a five-point agenda:

- Retrospective on last quarter
- Brainstorm on what could be done to make a significant difference in the next quarter
- What will have the biggest direct impact on goals
- What external things are happening that need to be factored into the plan
- What obstacles could stand in our way.
