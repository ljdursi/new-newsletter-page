[Why write ADRs [Architecture Decision Records]](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/) - Eli Perkins, GitHub blog

We've written before on the importance of recording the why's of architecture decisions. Even the best self-documenting code or infrastructure can only describe how it works, which is different from why it was implemented this way rather than another. Without that context, it's very difficult to know, when something changes, if the architecture should be reconsidered.
Perkins does a good job in a short article describing three good classes of reasons why to write them:

- They’re not for you, they’re for future you
- They’re not for you, they’re for your peers
- They’re not for you, they’re for your future peers

This is the computing equivalent of a standard project management [decision log](https://www.girlsguidetopm.com/project-decision-log/), which is used for the same reason in more general project management contexts.
