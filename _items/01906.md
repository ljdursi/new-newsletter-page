[RSE Group Evidence Bank](https://github.com/RSE-leaders/evidence-bank) - UK RSE

This is an interesting collection of job titles and descriptions from a number of UK RSE groups for job levelling (junior/RSE/senior/head of RSE), soe articles on setting up RSE or data science institutes.  Very interesting if youâ€™re thinking of starting an RSE group.  Hopefully it continues to grow.
