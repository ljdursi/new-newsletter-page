[Counterfactuals are not Causality](https://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2021/06/counterfactuals-are-not-causality/) - Michael Nygard

When you're digging into the (likely multiple) causes of a failure, Nygard reminds us that things that *didn't* happen can't, necessarily, be the cause of something.  To steal an example from the post, "The admin did not configure file purging" is not a cause.  It can suggest future mitigations or useful lessons learned, as "we should ensure that file purging is configured by default", but looking for things that *didn't* happen is a way for blame to sneak in and takes our eyes off of the system that lead to the bad outcome.
