[Secret tips for effective startup hiring and recruiting](https://www.rubick.com/startup-hiring-and-recruiting/) - Jade Rubick 

These articles read together give a sense of what a really good hiring process could look like. Rubrick’s article starts well before the job ad goes out, and continues well past the hiring of any one candidate; it’s about strategy, pipeline, and iterating. But it’s intended to quite a wide audience, so doesn’t go into the details of interviewing for a particular type of role, which is where Cheung’s steps in.

Rubick’s article starts very early on in the process.  What is your hiring *strategy*?  Why should someone work on your team as opposed to any of the other myriad of opportunities out there?  What does your team offer, what can you be flexible on or emphasize?  A clear and well articulated set of reasons and benefits here can be used in a number of places - your careers page, how you recruit, where you post ads, and more.

Rubrick then recommends putting real thought into the job description and ad, testing the application process to see what it looks like, (he also has a nice article on creating an [interview plan](https://www.rubick.com/coordinate-your-interviews-with-an-interview-plan/)), and moving quickly.

A great idea I haven’t seen anywhere else is to start assembling useful information for candidates - like an FAQ, and which can be added to with real candidate questions - and when it’s big enough to be useful, to begin sending it to candidates as part of the process once they get through the resume screen stage.  He also recommends giving feedback to and asking for feedback from candidates, keeping in touch with promising candidates, and actively recruiting based on everyone’s network.
