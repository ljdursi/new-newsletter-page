[OffBoarding as an Engineering Leader](https://medium.com/@IcchaSethi/offboarding-as-a-manager-4dd2454eb9dd) - Iccha Sethi

We’ve had a few articles here about your-first-90-days at a new job; this is an article about your last days as a manager as you move to a new position.

Sethi mentions several areas to focus on:

- Your team - informing them, and documenting pending performance issues, salary, equity, or promotion status, and then informing them of the departure
- Documenting the status of the team as a whole and their projects
- Documenting the status of any projects or initiatives you were pushing for
- Stakeholders - peer teams, and for us research groups - informing them and having a clear plan to hand them off to a specific individual
- Documenting a clear transition plan

There’s a lot to do!  The good news is that if you’ve been following the practices we’ve been recommending in this newsletter - one-on-ones with notes, regularly quarterly planning and reviews, project documention, and the like - many of these tasks become much easier.  And if not - well there’s no need to wait until you’re going to start a new job!
