[The Happiness and Stresses of Open Source work](https://drewdevault.com/2020/01/21/Stress-and-happiness.html) - Drew Devault<br/>
[My FOSS story](https://blog.burntsushi.net/foss/) - Andrew Gallant<br/>

Research computing teams have a lot in common with open source communities - even if you aren’t developers or developing open source software.   One of the joys of open source communities is that you’re part of a small, visible team solving problems for your users - and that’s exactly the situation we’re in.  But there’s downsides to that, too.  Users can be incredibly demanding, and when you’re a small visible team they can be directly demanding to you, personally.  Members of  huge proprietary teams don’t have that feedback. for good or ill; being one of thousands of devs on MS Word or staff in AWS it can be hard to feel like you’re making a difference, but you’re not getting emails from your users yelling at you because they don’t like that latest change you made.

There’s a lot of talk in FOSS communities these days about dealing with this feedback, including dealing with burnout, and I think this is something that managers should be keeping an eye on.
