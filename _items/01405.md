[What Makes a Good Changelog](https://workos.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-changelog) - Zeno Rocha, Herbert Lui, WorkOS

A very pragmatic about documentation for developers.  The most important thing about changelogs is that *they exist*.  And the easiest way to ensure thatâ€™s done is to have simple, clear, and non-onerous expectations of what they should look like.

Rocha and Lui specify:

- They should be clear
- In images, highlight changes
- Spotlight the people behind the product
- Consistent formatting of versions and dates, and...
- Teams should dedicate real technical staff time to them
