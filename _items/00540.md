[Never Skip Retros](https://theoverlap.substack.com/p/never-skip-retros) - Tim Casasola, The Overlap

In his new newsletter, Casasola argues that one of the most fundamental team meetings you can have are regular restrospectives, because:

- They disrupt the habit of anticipating the future,
- They are low hanging fruit, and
- They put teams on the path to continuously improve.

He goes on to suggest tools like [Parabol](http://parabol.co/) and [Fun Retrospetives](https://www.funretrospectives.com/) as tools to help with the retrospective process.

This isn't exclusively a software development (or even computing) practice; it's widespread in project management generally, and I think any time there's a natural place to take stock and look back, doing some kind of a "what went well, what should we take a look at for next time" meeting is well worth the time for the potential improvements.
