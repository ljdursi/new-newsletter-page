[Are your hiring filters working?](https://jhall.io/archive/2021/09/23/are-your-hiring-filters-working/) - Jonathan Hall

Once you are clear on the nature of candidates you’re trying to hire, it’s a lot easier to evaluate hiring processes - and once you have a documented repeatable process, you can evaluate and update iteratively.

As Hall points out, everything we do in the process - from the job ad to the application form questions and onward - is a hiring filter.  But is it a *good* filter?  Does it enrich for the candidates we actually want by filtering out the candidates that wouldn’t be a good match and preserving the candidates that would be a good match?  Have you checked?
