[Why Senior Engineers Hate Coding Interviews](https://medium.com/swlh/why-senior-engineers-hate-coding-interviews-d583d2855757) - Adam Storm

Storm’s piece is related to the discussion last month on hiring criteria, and matching evaluation to what people would actually be doing on the job.  Senior developers spend a more time deciding *what* to code than doing on-the-fly coding, and putting them into a whiteboard coding interview is stressful, unfamiliar, and doesn’t measure what you care about.  Storm emphasizes this point, and suggest that if you really want to see if they can code or not to give them a take-home assignment.
