[TinyBird Tech Test](https://gist.github.com/javisantana/42b96b41ba5a4de8fdce925b11074c9c) - Javi Santana, TinyBird

With a clear understanding of a role, it’s much easier to understand how to evaluate against that profile when you’re interviewing.  Santana provides one real take-home problem they use at [TinyBird](https://www.tinybird.co), a company that builds real-time data processing tools.  It involves writing up how you would solve a data ingest-plus-expose-an-API problem, and describes the rubric they use to answer it (it’s almost all about the communications, not the technical beauty of the proposed solution).
