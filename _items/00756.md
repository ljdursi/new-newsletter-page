[Visualizing Objects, Places, and Spaces: A Digital Project Handbook](https://handbook.pubpub.org) - Beth Fischer and Hannah Jacob, Wired!, Duke University

Fischer and Jacob are starting off on what looks like a really exciting project, assembling a handbook for starting digital projects in the humanities. It will be interesting to what comes of this effort - and if your team has helped support such a project, [they're seeking contributions](https://handbook.pubpub.org/get-involved).
