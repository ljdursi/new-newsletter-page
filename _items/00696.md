[Starting a new manager relationship](https://sallylait.com/blog/2020/10/28/starting-a-new-manager-relationship/) - Sally Lait

A lot of us in research computing become managers by being promoted within an organization, so we sometimes have the advantage (and disadvantage..) of an extended handover process between the previous manager and you.

Lait here describes her preferred method for taking over a team in such a situation:

- Initial hello and quick backgrounds - can be done in a group setting
- 1:1:1 handover - previous and new manager + team member meetings, find out current state of work and working relationship
- Getting to know you better 1:1
- Working agreement - figure out how you'll work together, how they prefer feedback etc
- Follow ups - in future one-on-ones
