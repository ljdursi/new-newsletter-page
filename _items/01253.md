[Use a candidate packet to improve your interview process](https://www.rubick.com/candidate-packet-for-interviews/) - Jade Rubick

[Last week](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/research-computing-teams-link-roundup-16-july-2021/) we looked at Rubick’s advice on hiring and recruiting, and one part was to provide a packet of information about the job, the work, and the organization to candidates after initial screening.  Here Rubick goes into more details on what to consider including:

- Details on the interview process
- Why the organization is important, what you’re trying to do
- How work works - remote if that’s relevant, or offices
- Benefits
- Salary bands and how salaries work
- How career growth and guidance works
- Information about inclusion and diversity

It’s a decent amount of work, but it will need updating only occasionally, and will make your organization look considerably more professional, more thoughtful about team members, and thus more trustworthy, than most of the organizations they’re applying to.
