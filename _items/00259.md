[The Engineering Manager Event Loop](https://www.chriseigner.com/engineering-manager-event-loop/) - David Loftesness via Chris Eigner

This isn’t new, but I really like the idea: what a generic tech software development manager should be thinking of daily, weekly, and monthly on people, projects, processes, and themselves.  It’s not quite right for research computing - thinking about recruiting and hiring on a daily basis is to put it mildly not the regime we’re normally in - but a lot of the other items hold up.   What other changes would we have to make?
