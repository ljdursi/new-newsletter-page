I really like this [documented hiring process](https://eng-hiring.18f.gov)
by 18F in the US Government.  It’s a well thought out process, and it’s written in a way that you could send to candidates so they know exactly what to expect. It’s even [in GitHub](https://github.com/18F/eng-hiring).

I also really like their [technical pre-work](https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/pre-work/) - it’s either to provide some code they’ve worked on, or to do one of four exercises.  The exercises are simple but non-trivial get-and-process-data exercises that would give a lot more confidence about ability to do real programming tasks than some kind of fizz-buzz.
