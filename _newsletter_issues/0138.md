I got a question from a reader this week which I'm surprised to see
that I haven't addressed before, and that I'm sharing with permission:

> I have several years experience [as an IC in research computing and data team].  With some changes
> coming up here in the next year or two there will be at least one manager job opening up.  I've been
> reading your newsletter for six months, and it's been really helpful!  Do you have any suggestions for
> what I can do to be ready as a good candidate for the job?

Below is the advice I shared, and I'd welcome any other suggestions
you have.  Is there anything else this reader should be doing or
thinking about?  Let me know and I'll pass it along, to them and
(with your permission) to other readers!

Congratulations!  Our community needs more new managers with
enthusiasm for doing the job well.  And I'd say that you paying
enough attention to your team's broader context to see this coming
and be thinking about the consequences is already a good sign.

The first thing I tell people who are thinking about this kind of
transition is to make sure that they are consistently doing their
current individual contributor work reliably and well, even as they
develop new skills.  In a way, this is weird advice!  The role
you're thinking of has very different work, requiring very different
skills, and being quite good at your current work doens't necessarily
correlate particularly well with being quite good at a lead or
manager role.  But it's vital to be seen as someone who reliably
gets things done.  Ideally, you want your manager, their manager, and
related stakeholders to be thinking "when I give X a task, it gets
done and I don't have to worry about it."  People will give more
responsibility to people who they have confidence in executing their
current responsibilities.  You don't need to be the most highly
skilled data scientist/software developer/sysadmin/research facilitator
on the team; but you will need to be someone that gets your things
capably and reliably done.

So on to the question asked.  There's rightly two parts to the
question -- how can I get ready, and how can I be seen as a good
candidate -- but there's a lot of overlap between answers to the
two.  If you're ready to start experimenting, and have some flexibity
about the tasks you can take on (which is pretty commonly true in
our teams, and one of their huge advantages), you can start practicing
some of the pieces of a lead or management role to build your skills
and to be seen as someone who will step up to do this work.

The first step is to discuss what you'd like to do with your manager,
in your one-on-ones with them if you have those, or as part of some
other conversation if you don't.  Depending on your situation and
relationship with them, you may not want to come out and say that you're
interested in the possible upcoming manager jobs.  That's doubly
true if you're not 100% sure that's what you want just yet!  But
you can absolutely talk about being interested in taking on more
responsibility, and what kind of opportunities would there be on the
team for that.

(Note that I'm generally pretty cautious when giving advice to
earlier career people about conversations with their managers or
other stakeholders.  Hopefully most will be warm, supportive, and
encouraging!  That's generally been my own experience.  But not
everyone has a manager like that, and a manager that starts feeling
threatend can make a team member's job pretty unpleasant.  So I
always advise starting conversations like these with baby steps and
seeing how they react.  If you have a strong relationship with your
manager or have had conversations like this before with them, then
by all means adjust my advice accordingly.)

Broadly I'd say there's three important areas where it's often the
case that a senior member of an RCD team can often start playing a role,
that would both develop skills and visibility necessary to being thought
of as a potential leader:

* Take on some responsibility for communicating with stakeholders (including but not necessarily limited to clients, decision makers, and peer teams)
* Take a role in supervising efforts larger than your own
* Supporting someone's professional development

(Others may arise, depending on your team circumstances: if your
team is going to be hiring someone, for instance, being involved
in that process would be extremely helpful)

If you are able to take on some of those tasks, then the skills you can
actively work on include:

* Seeing the larger view - looking ahead in time and more broadly than your own team
* Communicating clearly to different audiences
* Finding out what people need
* Mentoring and coaching
* Effectively coordinating work handoff
* Giving effective peer feedback

So once you've had your conversation with your manager, keep an eye
out for opportunities to take on those kinds of tasks.  With your
manager's support, or at least acquiesence, find one that's not too
big a lift for you, take it on, and spend some time to get good at
it.  Only then start keeping an eye out for second opportunity to
grow your role.  It's way too easy to let enthusiasm get the better
of us, and overwhelm ourselves with new kinds of work!  Develop one
set of new skills at a time; growing in new directions doens't
happen overnight.

Taking on some new responsibility for communicating with stakeholders
can be a pretty easy way to get started.  If you're not already doing it,
there's probably opportunities to onboard new researchers, present results,
connect one stakeholder with another with a similar interest, 


If you are already doing these kinds of tasks and really want to
test-drive being a manager, and it makes sense for your team and
the situation, being a supervisor for an intern or summer student
is really a full immersion into the work.  Working with an intern
or student is the whole lifecycle of working with a team member
wrapped up into a semester; figuring out what work has to be done,
hiring, onboarding, managing work and performance, giving feedback,
handoff of work, and off-boarding.

In some working with a student is it's even harder than managing a
staff member; pretty much by definition they're much more junior
and require more hand-holding.  In some ways it's easier, though
-- it's time-limited, and the student is probably going to be doing
some very well-defined pre-specified work.

A few months ago in
#[120](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0120) I
gave some advice about hiring a intern - including a [159-item
checklist for onboarding, managing, and offboarding
them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y8_fKdJBqrDPXD6sxEFa5E1vgGvwK1oIn1Fy2XIIvks/edit)
which some readers have found useful.  The advice there is still good.
It's a pretty clear opportunity to develop your feedback-giving
skills, being clear and specific while being supportive and not
overly prescriptive.  That's a real challenge for almost everyone.
It's also a pretty clear opportunity to build coaching and mentoring
skills; again, the challenge there is to help people grow and learn
while letting people do things themselves.

One last thing that I'd suggest is to spend the next year+ paying
attention to your own reactions to the different kinds of work
you're doing.  Many new managers really struggle with letting go
of hands-on work, with its very quick feedback on what you've
accomplished and how well you're doing.  Moving towards much
longer-term efforts, supporting people as they do the work, can be
very demoralizing.  As you take on some of these new duties, notice
how you feel about them.  Do you primarily get satisfaction from
delivering some code, analysis, or or job running?  Or do you also
find supporting people's growth and watching _them_ deliver the
work satisfying?  Be honest with yourself; there's no right answer
here.  The more satisfying you find watching the work be delivered
even with your your direct involvement, the more likely you are to
be able to find happiness in a lead or management role.

What do you think, (other) readers?  Did I miss something, or would
you have given different advice?  Let me know by hitting reply or
emailing me at jonathan@researchcomputingteams.org.

With that, let's move on to the roundup!
