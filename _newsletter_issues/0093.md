Hi - I hope your week has gone well.

I’ve been prompted by a few things to think about activity versus accomplishing lately.

Falling into a trap of doing *stuff*, and so feeling busy and industrious, but not actually getting anything meaningful accomplished is certainly a trap that individual contributors can get ensnared in.  We’ve all worked with someone (“or been someone”, he said sheepishly) prone to bike shedding or yak-shaving or some other flavour of spinning around in a rabbit hole without making forward progress.  (Whenever I have to explain yak-shaving to someone, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fnfeuoh4s8) is the youtube video I point them to).   It can *feel* like work to the IC, but to an external observer it’s pretty clear they’re stuck - they were tasked with doing the thing and they are very visibly not taking the direct route towards doing the thing.

But wow, with managers and above, the trap is *way* more subtle - and it’s not nearly as obvious to those around us when it happens.

Our work as managers or technical leaders is inherently only indirectly connected to the things getting done.  We keep the team aligned on goals, so that the right things get done.  We provide feedback and coaching so our team members can do things more effectively.  We delegate so that our team members can individually do bigger things.  We engage with stakeholders to find out what thing-doings need prioritization, and then we plan - now we’re getting two or three steps removed from things getting done.

So it’s deceptively, insidiously easy to fall into the trap of doing things that *look* like those important activities but have become unmoored from actually advancing the work of your team or the development and support of your team members.  To have meetings or planning sessions that may have been relevant at one point but now don’t actually advance any goals.  To engage with and collect feedback or input from stakeholders because that seems like the right thing to do, but the input doesn’t connect to any next steps - you’re taking measurements that aren’t informing decisions about anything concrete.

On my end, I’m on the periphery of engagement with an organization now that is very visibly being very busy doing *stuff* but not advancing meaningfully on any front.  And seeing that is actually kind of useful, because it’s making me re-evaluate some of the activities I’m doing.  One or two of them seemed like a good, well-motivated idea at the time, but in retrospect can be deleted with zero ill effects.

The only way as managers we can really tell is by having extremely clear priorities in mind, ideally in service of some kind of strategy, and being absolutely relentless about purging tasks that don’t advance those priorities.   Like everything in management, it’s not complicated - but it takes discipline to keep doing it.

## Managing Teams

[How to Get Your Silent 1-on-1s Back on Track](https://codecapsule.com/2021/09/09/how-to-get-your-silent-1-on-1s-back-on-track/) - Emmanuel Goossaert 

Whether it’s trust issues, or just overwhelm, one-on-ones can get quiet from time to time.  For almost any other kind of meeting, if the meeting is short because there’s not much to say, that’s a win!  But the purpose of one-on-ones is maintenance of a line of communication, more so than what is actually communicated in any given week.  If that line of communication isn’t functioning, we as managers need to do the maintenance work to get it the communication flowing again.

Goossaert suggests having a library of open-ended questions to prompt conversations:

- What has been on your mind these days?
- What’s the most exciting/interesting thing you’ve worked on since we last spoke?
- What has been the most frustrating thing for you over the past week?
- What is one thing within our team/org that you’re looking forward to?
- Is there something you’re trying to learn, either tech or soft skills? What can I do to help you with that?
- Anything I can support you with?

[The lettuce pact: The ultimate hack for giving difficult feedback](https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/lettuce-pact-for-difficult-feedback) - Brennan McEachran, Hypercontext

If you’re struggling to figure out how to improve your team’s frank but kind feedback to each other, McEachran has a suggestion.  Riffing off a [discussion from the Radical Candor team](https://www.radicalcandor.com/video-spinach-teeth/), the suggestion is to make things concrete, with a personally embarrassing but minor situation like someone about to give a talk with spinach between their teeth.  They clearly have a right to be told, and there’s clearly better and worse ways to share it with the person, but it’s hard to know how to bring it up.  It’s a good way to frame the discussion of giving feedback.

I think McEachran takes this too far and not far enough - a formal agreement 1:1 with each team member, but focussing only on personally embarrassing feedback rather than more generally telling someone that they’re not meeting an expectation - but nonetheless it may be a useful starting point for discussing feedback within your team.

[2021 Data/AI Salary Survey](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/2021-data-ai-salary-survey/) - Mike Loukides, O’Reilly

Apropos talking last week about hiring, and higher salaries in industry: a salary survey of 2,778 people in the US subscribing to the O’Reilly Data and AI newsletter found *average* salaries of $146,000 USD, and that includes the 31% who listed “Excel” as one of their main data tools (with salary $138k).  Of course, these early data scientist-track jobs pay significantly less than software developers or infrastructure teams pay, as a quick glance at salary sites like [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Microsoft&track=Software%20Engineer) will tell you.

In the survey, people working in the cloud or with ML frameworks (Spark ML, $175k; even scikit-learn $157k) had significantly higher salaries. 

Salaries were highest in tech ($160+) and lowest in non-profits and education (roughly tied at ~$100k).  

It’s ok - not great, but ok - if our salaries are that much lower, but we need to be clear-eyed about the disparities, and make sure that we’re making the work and the environment of the team worthwhile enough that they’re willing to take a substantial pay cut.

Also noted was a discouraging pay inequity, with women making 70-80% of what men make, and with an appallingly low 14% of respondents identifying as women.

![Data and AI average salaries in the US, across all job types, seniority, and states, by industry.  Nonprofit and education are lowest, just over $100k USD, while anything in industry starts at $125k, and the tech industry which is voraciously hiring is over $160k.](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/07-2048x1645.jpg)

## Managing Your Own Career

[Being the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) of Your Career](https://cate.blog/2021/09/20/being-the-dri-of-your-career/) - Cate

One of the benefits of being a or working with research trainees is that it drives home that we’re not going to be retiring from our roles (grad student, postdoc) - they’re stepping stones, usually to new institutions, and that we’re responsible for our career development.  

Even so, once we get a staff position, it’s easy to forget that.  Cate enjoins us to keep it in mind, and be relentlessly in charge of our own professional development and career next steps:

> My employer buys my time, they rent my personal brand […]. This concept also applies to expertise. My expertise is rented, and so I maintain my understanding of what it’s worth, and what is current on the open market.

## Research Software Development

[Coverage Is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness](https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/09/24/coverage-is-not-strongly-correlated-with-test-suite-effectiveness.html) - Greg Wilson <br/>
[Coverage is not strongly correlated with test suite effectiveness](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/papers/icse_2014_inozemtseva.pdf) (PDF)  - Laura Inozemtseva and Reid Holmes,  Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering

Wilson continues doing the important work of highlighting key empirical software engineering studies - in this case the work of Inozemtseva & Reid, who found a surprising result in an interesting way.

We had a “random” item about mutation testing in [#57](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0057) - testing effectiveness of test suites by making random changes to code and ensuring at least one test fails.  Here, Inozemtseva & Reid found that (sure enough) larger test suites caught more bugs - but apparently it’s the size of the test suite (*e.g.* number of tests) that is important; code coverage of the suite only tended to matter to the extent that large test suites were correlated with high coverage.   Wilson has more details, and of course the paper itself

[Ship / Show / Ask](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html?utm_campaign=Level%20Up&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) - Rouan Wilsenach

We’ve talked about pre-commit vs post-commit reviews in [#34](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0034) - post-commit being something of an alternative to PR review.  Changes that past CI testing get committed, so that developers aren’t blocked by waiting for review, and commits are reviewed later.  (Obviously this incentivizes a large test suite!)

Wilsenach suggests that you don’t have to have a culture where it’s either/or.  In the “Ship/Show/Ask” model, changes can be simply made without review (Ship) *or* post-commit review (or at least communication) happens for changes (Show) *or* pre-commit review happens (Ask), depending on the situation.

In practice, most of the research software development teams that I’ve seen have a “mostly-Ask” culture, but even there, we usually do in practice have an Ship/Ask model - no one requires PR approvals for fixing typos in documentations or the like.  Would it be beneficial to extend the boundaries of what is permissible to “just Ship”?  With “Show” for bigger changes that one things it would be useful to communicate?

What do your teams do in terms of review - pre, post, a mix?

## Research Data Management and Analysis

[KySync](https://kyall.notion.site/kyall/KySync-v1-0-29eaad446308449a8c9a2373850eed62) - Kamen Yotov, Ashish Thakkar, Chaim Mintz

[Rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) is a venerable peer-to-peer program to help changing files stay synced between machines, which inspired later tools like [Unison](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/).  Rsync allows sending only files or blocks of files that have changed.

KySync is a complete rewrite - taking advantage of modern C++ and threading - of [Zsync](http://zsync.moria.org.uk), a tool I hadn’t heard of, which takes the rsync approach and turns it into more of a client-server framework for distributing large amounts of data.  Whereas rsync has the server do much of the work necessary to serve the data, Zsync pushes that to the client (making it easier to serve large amounts of slowly-changing data).

KySync performs significantly better than zsync, particularly for large amounts of similar data, and can take advantage of large numbers of threads, as shown below:

![Transfer speeds (higher is better) for KySync vs Zsync, for a 5% update to a dataset, with varying file sizes and, for KySync, number of threads.  Zsync has an advantage for smaller data sizes (<2 GB), but KySync can throw more threads at the problem and have improved performance.](https://kyall.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fbb7186b6-7025-4b33-ac9d-240defb9d102%2Fsimilarity_95.png?table=block&id=1d260066-5af3-4b6a-bf6c-992a0bc666f6&spaceId=4dbe8b73-7c2d-4303-b00e-253bb0a2adbf&width=1280&userId=&cache=v2)

[Serving Netflix Video at 400Gb/s on FreeBSD (PDF)](https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=freebsd.org) - Drew Gallatin, EuroBSDCon 2021

These are the slides of a [talk](https://2021.eurobsdcon.org/home/speakers/#serving) given by Gallatin at last week’s EuroBSDCon.

We tend to think of obsessing about memory bandwidth and NUMA domains as being exclusively the domain of HPC and big research computing, but it’s really not - no one wants their compute to be unnecessarily bottlenecked.  Here, Gallatin talks about the process of getting data from disk out to the network as quickly as possible, on 32-core AMD EPYC Rome systems.

Data is pulled off of disk into memory via RDMA, encrypted (TLS) by the CPU, written back to memory, and fed out the network card.  In the worst case, each one of those hops goes over a NUMA link, completely saturating the 280GB/s Infinity fabric.

Gallatin walks through improving, this, first through network-centric siloing - keep everything on the NUMA node associated with the network card.  Then using kernel-bypass TLS in the NIC cards, drastically cutting CPU ↔ memory bandwidth requirements (and walks through how the smart NIC handles this), and playing with relaxed ordering of PCIe operations.  There’s some interesting comparisons to Ampere Alta ARM boxes, and Ice Lake Xeons - and, familiar to anyone who has given a talk on their scientific work, an allusion to an experiment that couldn't be done because of a last-minute delay.

## Emerging Technologies and Practices

[Tammy Bryant Butow on SRE Apprentices](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/sre-apprentices/) - Thomas Betts, InfoQ<br/>
[Advice for Tech Workers to Navigate the Most Heated Job Market of All Time](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/advice-for-tech-workers-to-navigate) - Gergely Orosz

It’s difficult to hire, especially senior people, for new-fangled roles such as anything involving cloud, deployment, web technologies, or anything security related.

In the first article, Butow talks with Betts about how her team bypassed this problem by hiring people for six-month apprenticeships in site reliability engineering, and keeping on those who succeeded - with the others leaving with six months of training in an extremely hot field.

Butow’s team was at Dropbox, which is sizable, but notably she was hiring for the databases team within Dropbox, which was at the time only four people.  So this isn’t necessarily limited to being something only some huge team can handle.  Particularly if paired with peer teams across an institution, this would be a relatively doable.

InfoQ articles lead helpfully with a Key Takeaways section which I’ll copy verbatim here:

- Hiring new site reliability engineers can be challenging. Dropbox decided to create a program to teach a cohort of students the skills necessary to be successful SREs.
- A non-traditional approach to find engineers will naturally lead to a more diverse set of applicants. Bringing in people with different backgrounds can lead to new ways of looking at common problems.
- Training should start with small tasks, letting the engineer learn by doing. Gradually these build from one-day tasks to longer, one-week, or one-month projects.
- If your company creates a formal training program, it needs to be communicated to everyone, so there is understanding and proper expectations when the apprentices work with other employees.
- In any new role, there is a need for understanding how to communicate with other people. Inviting junior employees to meetings allows them to see how senior members of the team interact to solve problems.

Note that this requires real work, with a real thought-out curriculum and mentoring support, and onboarding into increasingly larger tasks.

In Orosz’s case he’s giving advice to people in tech about the current job market (spoiler: if more money is something you need or want, you should start looking for a new job).  But, relevantly to Butow’s interview - the only area that this is *not* true is junior employees, because (from Orosz’s perspective) training up juniors is still hard and labour-intensive in a mostly-remote world.   This is a place where research computing - often embedded in institutions *dedicated to education!* can shine and take advantage of their strengths.
