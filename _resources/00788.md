[Productivity Is About Your Systems, Not Your People](https://hbr.org/2021/01/productivity-is-about-your-systems-not-your-people) - Daniel Markovitz

It came up in our discussions of some "measuring developer productivity" articles last year that, especially in research, *teams* are productive, not individuals. And to make teams productive you have to spend time (leveraged!) time of making sure your team processes are working smoothly. That means ensuring good communications, making work visible (we've been pushing towards Jira and Confluence - it's been a slog bug we're starting to see the benefits) and clarifying communications expectations.
