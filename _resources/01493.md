[What needs to change? That’s easy. How and when is the hard part](https://theskip.substack.com/p/what-needs-to-change-thats-easy-how). - Nikhyl Singhal

We’ve seen in the last 22 months that things can change very quickly when everyone agrees they need to change.  Singhal talks about the preconditions for enacting change, such as when many of us went to remote work:

- Agreement on the problem that needs solving
- A collective sense of urgency
- Quick Wins
- Required resources to deliver change - Trust, Time, Team

It’s necessary, but not enough that there’s widespread agreement on the problem that needs solving; it then needs to be understood to be a priority to solve.  Only then can you successfully start making the changes - by starting with some quick wins, and gaining the resources (people, time, and the trust of people who will be affected) to make the big change.
