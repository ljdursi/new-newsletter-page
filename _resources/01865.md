[Managing people](https://klinger.io/posts/managing-people-🤯) - Andreas Klinger

This is a bullet-point list aimed at new managers, and so there’s some basics here - but it’s always useful to review the basics, and we always have new members joining the list (hi!) including new managers.

I like this list because it expresses a lot of ideas that have come up on the list before, but in ways I haven’t read.  I wouldn’t necessarily express all of those thoughts this way, but it’s useful to get another take on ideas.  Some highlights:

- As a manager, everything is your fault
- You manage processes; you lead people
- Processes are expectations made explicit
- In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions
- Avoid back and forth
- Trust through transparency
- Don't confuse autonomy and abandonment

I think the last one I chose, “don’t confuse autonomy and abandonment”, is particularly relevant in academic areas of research computing.  We tend to expect and grant a large degree of autonomy - which is great!   But that doesn’t mean not giving our team members what they need to succeed, *including* as much context and, yes, guidance and direction as they require.  The trick is not to always be giving them *more* guidance and direction than they require.
