[One mentor isn’t enough. Here’s how I built a network of mentors](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2021/03/one-mentor-isnt-enough-heres-how-i-built-network-mentors) - Erika Moore

We’ve talked about assembling a group of mentors before, such as in [#60.](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/30a4d654-40af-4ae7-a88d-6892f832ee10)  People by and large are more than happy to give advice and suggestions to others coming up in their field.  Here Moore, writing in Science’s careers section, gives very specific and useful steps about how to build a network of people that one can ask for advice:

- Cast a wide net
- Get to the point - send short emails with very specific asks (which requires clarity on your part of what you want from them)
- Come prepared for those who do say yes
- Consider the context - things that worked for them might not work for you, and people may have a lot going on right tnow and be unable to help
