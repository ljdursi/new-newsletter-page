[Managers: What do you do when your teammate shares their grief?](https://larahogan.me/blog/managers-when-teammate-shares-grief/) - Lara Hogan

Hogan, taking lessons from her mothers pastoral care when she was going up, shares some humane steps you can take if someone unexpectedly shares grief with you over a significant tragedy in their lives. These steps are human for both the team member and you. The steps are:

- Have a handy, simple response ready - Hogan has a few to hand such as "Oh, I'm so sorry" or "That sounds incredibly tough"
- Don’t hop into problem-solving mode, and don’t make this about you. Ask open questions instead. "What would be most useful for you right now?" and the like
- Mirror their energy, use affirming body language - nod, eye contact, lean in.
- Create lots of silence and space - don't fill silence, let them take their time.
- Consider: what’s your role?
- Following up afterwards
