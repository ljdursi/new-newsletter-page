[Low-code contributions through GitHub](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/09/low-code-contributions-through-GitHub/) - Isabela Presedo-Floyd, Mars Lee, Melissa Weber, Mendonça, Tony Fast, Quansight Labs

Interesting experience getting people who wouldn’t normally code to make contributions to a project via github.   In this case, the effort was around alt text for images (including scientific diagrams!) for a project, based on pull requests, but I could imagine it working well for documentation, sourcing diagrams, or other contributions.

The team’s process was:

1. pre-meeting preparation with a project contributor and meeting facilitator
2. a crash course in the specific topic - eg alt text for images
3. an introduction to a collaborative pull request created by a project contributor
4. group working session to suggest changes to specific files assigned in the pull request
5. a short review of the submissions by the core contributor
6. final review by the core contributor to submit a final pull request

Github’s web interface is pretty approachable (with some guidance) for making these kinds of contributions - it’s good to see that it works well.
