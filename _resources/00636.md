[Learning with Fist of Five Voting](https://jakecalabrese.com/learning-with-fist-of-five-voting/) - Jake Calabrese

We've talked before about the benefits of not asking your team binary yes/no questions about agreement but "on a scale of 1..5"; e.g. in [#39](https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/26967bc4-8d8e-4f76-b86f-4fd7d94590be) when mentioning the use of zoom polls. This gives people who aren't comfortable with a direction a way to express that without coming out and saying no. And if a number of people vote 1 or 2 or 3, that will give them a bit more confidence in discussing why.

Calabrese describes a simple and fast way of doing the same without needing polling functionality (but also without anonymity) - holding up a hand with 0-5 digits showing varying levels of support for an idea. 0 (just a fist) is more or less adamant opposition, 5 is wild support, and anything in between is in between.
