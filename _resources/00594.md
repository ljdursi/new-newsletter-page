[A Software Development Life Cycle for Research Software Engineering](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse/wiki) - Kings Digital Lab

There was a really interesting SORSE talk this past week, [Digital Humanities RSE: Kingâ€™s Digital Lab as experiment and lifecycle](https://sorse.github.io/programme/talks/event-027/) by James Smithies and Arianna Ciula. The Digital lab, which hosts and maintains 160+ digital humanities projects, has a very nice lifecycle model for the research software development/hosting/maintenance efforts they get involved in, and they've generously made it, and templates for the documents at every step along the cycle, available to the community. If you're interested in creating or revisiting a lifecycle model for project engagement with your research communities, this is a good place to look.
