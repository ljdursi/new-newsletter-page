[Well-researched advice on software team productivity](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/well-researched-advice-on-software-team-productivity/) - Ari-Pekka Koponen, Swarmia

Management is hard, management of something as complex and ambiguous as software development is especially hard, but that doesn’t mean we don’t know anything.  There has been a lot of research on what works for making teams work well, and recently particularly in the area of software development.  It doesn’t mean there are cookie-cutter solutions for anything, but we do have good guidelines.   Koponen walks us through several well-supported (and in some cases ongoing) reports, many of which RCT readers will have already known about

- [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/) ([#46](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0046)) - The follow up to Google’s Project Oxygen, going beyond the effect of single managers to team behaviours. They found that five factors were very strongly correlated with high performing teams
  - Psychological safety - team members feeling comfortable speaking up
  - Dependability of other team members
  - Structure and clarity
  - Work having meaning, and
  - Work having impact
- [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) - These are aimed for those developing *and operating* software systems, but many of them are relevant to those writing and releasing software:  they find that teams that are performing well have:
  - High deployment frequency - it’s easy to update the software and keep it working
  - Low Mean Lead Time for Changes
  - Low Change Failure Rate for changes to need to be rolled back
  - Low Time to Recovery for the times that errors do occur
- [SPACE](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3454124) ([#66](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/newsletter_issues/0066)) found that focussing on these five areas were important for self-reported high-performing teams:
  - Satisfaction and well-being
  - Performance
  - Activity
  - Communication & Collaboration
  - Efficiency & Flow

And most importantly, Retrospectives - learning and adapting practices based on what is actually happening on your team - allows you to tune.
