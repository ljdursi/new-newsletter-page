[The Zero-prep Postmortem: How to run your first incident postmortem with no preparation](https://jhall.io/posts/zero-prep-postmortem/) - Jonathan Hall

It’s never too late to start running postmortems on your systems when something goes wrong.  It doesn’t have to be an advanced practice, or super complicated.  Hall provides a script for your first couple.

I’d suggest that once you have the basic approach down,  move away from “root causes” and “mitigations” and more towards “lessons learned’.  Those lessons learned can be about the postmortem process itself, too; you can quickly start tailoring it for your team and work.
