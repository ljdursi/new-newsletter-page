There's been a two good particularly good AWS tutorials from two different angles this week.

**[AWS HPC Workshop](https://www.hpcworkshops.com)** - Pierre-Yves Aquilanti, Anh Tran, Linda Hedges, AWS <br>

This is a nice introduction to playing with AWS from the point of view of an experienced HPC hand - it goes from the familiar (ssh'ing into a remote machine, setting up a cluster - but one that scales - setting up a performant parallel POSIX file system) to the less familiar (AWS Batch and containers).  So it's a nice transition.

On the other hand, that can sort of reinforce the HPC "way of doing things"; a more eye-opening approach might be to start dabbling with the cloud for the sort of tools that migrated first.  J Cole Morrison has started an ["Understanding Modern Cloud Architecture"]( https://start.jcolemorrison.com/understanding-modern-cloud-architecture-on-aws-a-concepts-series/) series of which the first three are published; it's less hands on but walks the reader through building a modern web application in a more idiomatically "cloud-native" way.
