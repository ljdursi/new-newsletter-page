[Your Calendar = Your Priorities](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4952-your-calendar-your-priorities) - John Cutler

Cutler points out that our scarcest resource is time.  There’s a saying in policy circles “Show me your budget and I'll tell you what your priorities/values are”; in research computing managerial work, where our budget is typically pretty constrained, it’s our *time* which reflects our implicit priorities.  Those implicit priorities may not be what they should be!   Looking at your calendar (and making sure your calendar reflects what you actually do - e.g. blocking off time for working on things) is one of the most powerful tools you have to make sure your effort is being focussed where it should be.
