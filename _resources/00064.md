One of the challenges leading research computing teams I mentioned this week was having to stay on top of technical and management work, while also understanding the relevant domain-knowledge use cases.  Training people up in those two areas at the same time is an issue too; the hiring pool of people who already know both of those areas well is small, and much smaller than the number of people who know one or the other and are willing to learn.

In technology companies it’s becoming more common to split technical manager responsibilities into “people leadership” and “technical leadership” career paths; the technical leads have increasing levels of technical decision making responsibility, and help mentor and train junior colleagues, but aren’t responsible for managing.  A discussion of why and how are given in this [blogpost](http://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder) and [description of the paths](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxmQBrDZvj16veuc2OVO0wUX7a7vEKPM-57dNLXhuEk/edit) by Camille Fournier, and some companies have [developed detailed training/mentoring plans](https://medium.com/@bellmar/heroes-and-juniors-increasing-engineering-team-velocity-97ce6a59103e) and [courses](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan) to help their junior technical staff progress along the career path. These two posts by Keavy McMinn describes what it looks like, day to day, to be on a technical leader at GitHub.

In research computing we don’t have large teams, so we tend not to make formal such distinctions, but informally there are certainly team members we implicitly or explicitly trust with such technical decision making.  Does your team formalize that at all?  Is trying to develop a technical leadership path worth trying to do, or does it require HR support and increasing pay scales to make it work (the way it happens at tech firms)?  The modest promotion possibilities in research computing and lack of alternate career paths has been [pointed out before](https://cosden.github.io/RSE-career-path#challenge_4) as a hinderance for hiring and keeping staff. Have you seen any research computing teams go this way?
