[Demo-driven development](https://www.rubick.com/demo-driven-development/) - Jade Rubick

From earlier in the year - Rubick describes his method for introducing stories and planning into software development, by starting with routine demos, backing from that into introduction of user stories by structuring the plans for the next demo, and then from there moving out into routine planning. Whatâ€™s nice about this is that it keeps the important thing - always be delivering something useful - in the forefront.
