[How to release 2 years of unfinished code, the "Agile way"](https://jhall.io/archive/2022/04/03/how-to-release-2-years-of-unfinished-code-the-agile-way/) - Jonathan Hall

Sometimes you get yourself into a hole and need to find a way out.  Hall recommends releasing *something* that works right away - some teeny change to the last related version - just to practice the (now quite out of date!) release process and give your team a quick win.  It could even be a version bump and a change to the docs!  Release something, then find a way to maybe fold in a little of the new code, and release again.

I expect the most controversial recommendation is:

> Treat the last 2 years worth of code as “warehouse of old parts”
> That is to say: Don’t try to force the 2 years worth of code into production. Instead, put it to the side, and essentially start over, using an agile approach of building one valuable thing at a time. As you do this, feel free to rummage through the “warehouse of old parts” and pull in bits and pieces that are relevant, of course.
