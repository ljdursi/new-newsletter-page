I apparently became the last person in the world to hear about [Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette), a lovely python package that lets a researcher (or anyone else) make a data in a read-only SQLite database available through an API or a simple web UI, for querying or for running SQL queries.  Itâ€™s pretty basic, but addresses a key building block in a lot of simple projects.
