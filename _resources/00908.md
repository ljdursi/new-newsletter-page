[Ten simple rules for starting (and sustaining) an academic data science initiative](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008628) - Micaela S. Parker, Arlyn E. Burgess, Philip E. Bourne, PLOS Computational Biology

Many research computing centres are trying to figure out how to launch or scale up a data science core facility or research institute.  Creating anything new within an organization is a challenge, even when the winds are in your favour.  Parker, Burgess, and Bourne offer some very sage advice on not just starting up a data science effort in particular, but creating something new within an organization more broadly.

Some key points made are:


- Don’t try to own everything
- Leverage champions
- Establish a set of guiding principles
- Focus on interdisciplinary, but don’t overdilute

All of these are about having a very clear understanding of what you want to achieve, the organizational environment and which teams have skills or capabilities that can be complementary to that and building on the enthusiasm of others.  Another key point:


- Recognize and elevate data, software, and workflow contributions

As you’re creating the thing, you need to make sure that the incentives within your piece of the organization don’t work against what you’re trying to build.  A data science facility within a team that doesn’t consider data, software or workflow work “real science” is going to have a hard time retaining people.
