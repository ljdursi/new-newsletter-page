[Maker vs Multiplier](https://www.patkua.com/blog/maker-vs-multiplier/) - Pat Kua

There’s an old joke about becoming a 10x developer by spending your time helping ten other developers become twice as effective.  I think this article is a nice way to distinguish between the contributions of individual contributors and those doing “glue work” like us managers (not that you have to be a manager to be doing multiplier-type work).
