Research computing and data teams are important.  Creating them, managing them, defining their focus, 
and helping them deliver for researchers doesn't have to be stressful or mysterious.

### Resources

I'm starting to put together specific resources distilled from advice in the newsletter.  
The first is my quickstart guide ([PDF](http://127.0.0.1:4000/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.pdf), [epub](http://127.0.0.1:4000/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.epub)) to getting starting with one-on-ones, listing out daily steps and resources to get one-on-ones up and running over the course of a month.  More are coming!
