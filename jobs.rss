      <title>Collaboration Manager, UK AI Factory Antenna, EPCC - University of Edinburgh</title>
      <description><p>We are seeking a project manager to be in charge of activities that will identify and engage with new users and organisations for UKAIFA. Engagement and outreach work will involve a range of approaches, from roadshows at industry events and specific industry bodies, workshops with individual organisations (including research organisations) or sectors, and one-on-one discussions. Part of the activities will simply be promotional, raising awareness of UKAIFA, the resources available through UKAIFA and the wider AI ecosystem within the UK and European Union, and the services available (from training through to consultancy) to help organisations benefit from AI technologies.
However, they will also involve more in-depth engagements, including events such as hackathons and development sprints, where AI approaches can be developed, and requirements and desired solutions can be prototyped and storyboarded.</p>

New acquisitions include a cryo-electron transmission microscope (cryo-TEM; Glacios 2) and a cryo-focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (cryo-FIB-SEM; Aquilos 2).   The successful candidate must be able to support a variety of cryo-TEM-related activities, both independently and in collaboration with users ranging from those seeking the services of an expert microscopist (i.e., researchers with minimal cryo-TEM understanding) to those seeking training to become independent cryo-electron microscopists. The job includes substantial TEM management (instrumentation and user base) as well as training aspects, as the CharFac has a long history of training and mentoring students and postdocs to use state-of-the-art materials characterization instrumentation. The successful applicant will have opportunities beyond their support duties to pursue their own independent research. In support of this, the role will also come with an affiliate title of Research Assistant Professor.</p>

      <title>Team Lead for HPC Engineering - Oak Ridge National Laboratory</title>
      <description><p>We&#x27;re hiring a Team Lead for HPC Engineering to focus on the growth and management of our team, and providing oversight of technical projects/operations in direct support of our customers and projects! This position resides in the emerging Technologies and Computing (ETAC) group in the Research Computing Support (RCS) division of the Information Technology Services Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). ETAC focuses on support researcher’s HPC computing, Data engineering and management, Infrastructure as a Service, and new technology needs. Staff charge directly to projects or programs, and not to a centralized budget. Our goal is to enable research while protecting ORNL assets, especially from cyber incidents.  Team Leads manage staff, assigning them to projects in many directorates. RCS staff who support those directorates report directly to you. The expectation is that a small amount of your time will be spent on research projects as well. Routine meetings with the customer (those providing funding) and the directorate management are needed to ensure IT needs are being met, and to manage workload as projects ramp up and down.</p>
