## Resources and next steps

My suggestion would be to start with one-on-ones. Here is a quickstart guide ([PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.pdf),
[epub]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/howto-one-on-ones.epub)) to getting starting with one-on-ones.  It lists out daily steps and resources
to get one-on-ones up and running over the course of a month.

Other resources presesnted in the talk are below -
