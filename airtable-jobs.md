Research Computing is a tough field that combines the challenges of many disciplines, and managing research computing teams is a specialty. Here I keep track of jobs in that specialty; highlights are posted weekly in the Research Computing Teams [Newsletter](https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/archive)

[Submit a job](https://airtable.com/shrL6QGic3Mv9JFrs) to have it added to the job board for free; listings will appear once they have been approved for relevance and as non-spam.  Jobs should have, as a responsibility, the managing of projects or products, or the leading or mentoring of people.

Recent jobs can be followed on RSS at [jobs.rss](/jobs.rss)
